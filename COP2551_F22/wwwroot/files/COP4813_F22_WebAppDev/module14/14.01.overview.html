            Building web apps from the MVC template is something that I really
            enjoy. As you become more familiar with the tools, you can leverage 
            them to create unique and useful applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            This week is about collaboration. You will be working through the 
            next steps of your code and collaborating with others to create 
            something useful.
        </p>
        <p>
            See the Discussion page for this week for more details.

        <p>
            The Bookstore website presented in this chapter is a realistic
            website that uses the skills presented so far in this book.
            This app encompasses all of the material in the earlier chapters.
        </p>
        <p>
            Over the next two weeks, you will work through the Bookstore web
            application in Chapter 13 and a related exercise. I think that 
            time spent in this chapter will be time well spent. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The complete code is available for download from the publisher.
            I suggest that you take a pass at it on your own before using 
            the code as reference, then practice with Exercise 13-1 using the
            ex_starts code. This will help with the programming assignment
            for this module.
