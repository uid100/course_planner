        <p>
            Throughout this course we have written some web applications. The MVC pattern is an 
            important one. As with anything, the more you use it, the easier it gets and the more 
            you can do with it.
        </p>
        <p>
            There is one more piece that we did not get to. Deploying your application to the internet
            so that it can be used by other systems and users.
        </p>
        <p>
            You won&quot;t have to hand anything in for this module, but it is a short demonstration
            and I think it is worth doing. Let me know your thoughts.

            Deploy to Azure - A Quick Demo
        </p>
        <p>
            I like to write code. Especially, I like MVC apps hosted in ASP.NET. Leveraging built-in templates,
            it is easy to get something up and running and ready to customize, very quickly. The specific use-case
            and the data returned is not the focus for this exercise. Any tested web app should work.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once your app is working and producing the results that you want, how can you make it available to
            anyone for use across the internet?
        </p>
        <p>
            There are several hosting service providers available. This example will require an Microsoft Azure
            account, but if you are careful and follow the instructions closely and carefully, there are many
            services that are available at no cost.
        </p>
        <p>
            The following was in response to a student request. She wanted her application to auto-populate city
            and state data for a user using an API ZIP code lookup. The API we chose for this does not require an
            API key for testing and casual use. It does have limits on how many results it will return, but for
            most usage, it is exactly what we needed for this testing.

        <h3 class="alert alert-info">Instructions</h3>

        <p>
            For this exercise, you can use any web app that you have built, or you can download my sample code
            and use that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Open Visual Studio and choose <strong>Clone a repository</strong> (or open your own.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Enter <em>https://github.com/uid100/locationlookup.git</em> for the location.
        </p>
        <p>
            Visual Studio will create a local clone of the repository and you will see the files added in
            the solution explorer. If the solution does not open automatically, double-click the solution 
            file (locationlookup.sln) from the file list and build and run it locally to see that it works.
        </p>
        <p>
            Assuming the project builds and runs correctly, right-click the project and from the pop-up
            context menu, choose <strong>Publish...</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            Choose Azure to publish to the Microsoft cloud and Next.
        </p>
        <p>
            Select Azure App Service (Windows). (Next.) This is a managed platform which seamlessly hosts ASP.NET
            applications.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you are signed in, you can select between creating a new app service or selecting an existing 
            as the target. From here you will also see a list of available subscriptions for billing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Choose an available subscription and click the plus (+) sign to create a new app service.
        </p>
        <p>
            Give your application a name. By default, Azure will assign the project name and a timestamp:<br />
            locationlookup20221122153627   (project name + YYYY + MM + DD + HH + mm + ss)<br />
            Sometimes the timestamp is helpful. The name will be part of the URL. If I enter "ziplookup" then 
            my application URL will be "https://ziplookup.azurewebsites.net." This needs to be a unique
            name, so Azure will check that it is.
        </p>
        <p>
            I recommend keeping projects in shared resource groups, and by habit, I always add "_rg" to 
            resource group names. So in this case, I chose "New" and created the resource group.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you have an app name, an available subscription, and a resource group, perhaps the most
            important part of this is to scale the app correctly. Since this is a simple proof of concept
            that I want to build and test and share with a few people, this is not going into large scale
            production, from the drop down I can select the "Free" service level. This will be more than 
            adequate for our purposes, and will not generate any unintended costs. <strong>Be careful,</strong>
            the default service level will incur a monthly cost, so be sure that you do not skip this step.
        </p>
        <p>
            Select Create and the app service will be created in Azure. Once this finishes, after a short
            delay, there is still one more step. Click Finish and Visual Studio will creating the publishing
            profile with the newly created app service.
        </p>
        <p>
            Finally, click the Publish button. Visual Studio will build the package and publish it to the
            new App Service and will open the new web app in your default browser.
        </p>
        <p>
            Try opening your website on a mobile device to see how it looks there.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that your app service has been created, you can continue to develop and test your application 
            (locally), and when you want to update it to the web, right-click the project name (in the solution
            explorer) and choose Publish and the same publish profile will be used. So you can push the updates
            to the web with just a couple of clicks and refresh the view on your mobile device to see the
            changes.
