                A web app, also known as a web application, consists of a set of web 
                pages that are generated in response to user requests. The Internet 
                has many different types of web apps such as search engines, online 
                stores, news sites, social sites, music streaming, video streaming, 
                and games, p. 4.</li>
            <li>
                What is the difference between an intranet, the Internet, and the 
                cloud. P. 5:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>An intranet is a local area network (LAN) that connects 
                    computers that are near each other, usually within the same 
                    building or domain.</li>
                    <li>The Internet is a network that consists of many wide area 
                    networks (WANs), and each of those consists of two or more 
                    LANs.</li>
                    <li>The cloud refers to software and services that run on the 
                    Internet, instead of locally on your computer. This term 
                    implies that you do not have to understand how it works to 
                    be able to use it.</li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                A URL consists of the protocol (usually, HTTPS), domain name,
                path, and filename. If you omit the protocol, HTTPS is assumed.
                If you omit the filename, the web server typically looks for a
                file named index.html, index.htm, default.html, or default.htm,
                p. 5.

            <li>
                A static web page is stored in a file that contains hard-coded content 
                that does not change each time it is requested. This type of web page 
                is sent directly from the web server to the web browser when the browser 
                requests it, p. 6.</li>
            <li>
                A dynamic web page is a page that&rsquo;s generated by a web app program 
                on an application server. This program uses the data that is sent with 
                the HTTP request to generate the HTML that is returned to the 
                application server, p. 8.</li>

                Review the Components of the MVC pattern and the Benefits of the MVC 
                pattern, p. 11.</li>
            <li>
                Review the ASP.NET programming models and their properties, p. 13.</li>

                The <em>.NET Framework</em>, also known as just <em>.NET</em>, only
                supports the Windows operating system. The <em>.NET Core</em> platform
                is open source and supports multiple operating systems including Windows,
                macOS and Linux, p. 15.

            <li>
                Middleware can generate the content for a response, edit the content 
                of a request, edit the content of a response, and short circuit a 
                request, p. 17. The Startup.cs file contains the code that configures 
                the middleware that is used by the app. This means it builds the 
                middleware pipeline for the app, p. 31.</li>
            <li>
                State refers to the current status of the properties, variables, and 
                other data maintained by an app for a single user. HTTP is a 
                <em>stateless protocol</em>. That means it does not keep track of state 
                between round trips. Once a browser makes a request and receives a 
                response, the app terminates and its state is lost, p. 19.</li>
            <li>
                Visual Studio Code is a code editor that can be used to develop all 
                types of .NET apps, including ASP.NET Core apps. It does not provide 
                as many features as an IDE like Visual Studio. A key feature of VS 
                Code is that it runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux, pp. 22-23.</li>
            <li>
                NET Core MVC uses a software design paradigm known as <em>convention 
                over configuration</em>, or <em>coding by convention</em>. This reduces 
                the amount of configuration that developers need to do if they follow 
                certain conventions, pp. 24-25.</li>
            <li>
                You typically use C# classes (.cs files) to define controllers and 
                models. You typically use Razor views (.cshtml files) to define 
                views, p. 25.</li>
            <li>
                The static files for an app can include CSS libraries such as 
                Bootstrap or JavaScript libraries such as jQuery. In addition, 
                they can include custom CSS or JavaScript files that override 
                the code in these libraries, pg. 25.</li>
