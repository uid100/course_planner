        In the last module, we explained a little about what the <strong>git</strong> tool was built to do and 
        (manually) created a repository on <strong>github.</strong> This week we will walk through another way
        to create and maintain your github repositories.

        <em>Note:</em> These instructions are going to be specific to using Visual Studio 2022 on Windows. Many
        of these same concepts apply if you are using Visual Studio for Mac, but the steps are different. If you
        only have access to a mac, please let me know as soon as possible to discuss an alternative to these 
        instructions.

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Create a new web application.</strong>
            <p>
                Launch Visual Studio, create a new project using the ASP.NET Core MVC template. Rename it whatever you like.
                When the project is ready, run it and see that it launches your browser and the Welcome page appears.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Create a git repository.</strong>
            <p>
                If you installed the source control workload when you installed Visual Studio, notice (do not select)
                the lower right corner of the Visual Studio app has a link that says "Add to Source Control."
                Visual Studio also has a menu item: <strong>Git > Create Git Repository</strong> both of these
                bring up the same dialog.
            </p>
            <p>
                Select GitHub on the left. Do not change the local repository path settings. You can click the box
                to Add a README if you would like.
            </p>
            <p>
                For the GitHub repository options, add your Account (login) information and clear the Private repository
                checkbox. <strong>Create and Push</strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                The first time that you do this, there may be another dialog which asks you to authenticate. If you
                are already logged into visual studio and your instance is associated with your Github account, it will
                automatically configure the new Github repository.
            </p>
            <p>
                Notice the "Add to Source Control" option in the lower right is no longer there, and it has been replaced
                by other (github) menu items.
            </p>
            <p>
                When it finishes, open Github in the browser and find the repository that you just created. If you
                added a README file, it will be displayed, without much content. Your code files (from the template)
                will be listed at the top of the page. The (Green) Code button will display the link to the repository,
                you will want this later.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Update the Application</strong>
            <p>
                Close the browser and go back to Visual Studio. Open the Views/Home/Index.cshtml file and make some
                edits. From the template there is a "div" tag with a heading and a paragraph with a link. Change
                the page in some way. What you change is up to you.
            </p>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Commit your changes.</strong>
            <p>
                Open the Git Changes tab ( from menu: View > Git Changes ). This usually appears beside the Solution
                Explorer Panel by default. You can move the tool from its default location, but I do not recommend it.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will see at the top that there are 0 outgoing and 0 incoming changes waiting. And further down
                a list of all of the files that have changed (from the local repository, which is sync-ed with the
                server.) Type a comment in the message box. This is required for every set of changes that you "check-in."
                For now, "Customized Views/Home/Index page" is enough.
            </p>
            <p>
                Beside the Commit All button, there is a drop down arrow. Select "Commit All and Sync" When the sync
                completes the pane will say there are no changes. Browse back to the repository, select the folder and
                the files that you changed, and notice the message on the table matches your 'commit message.' On any
                of the file or folder pages, you can select the History button to see the history of changes to the
                project. In time your commit messages will be more and more clear, specific, and helpful so that you
                have a clear revision history of your projects.
