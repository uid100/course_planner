                Chapter 3 How to make a web app responsive with Bootstrap

            In Module 3, there are two major objectives.
            <li>
                First, read through Chapter 3 to learn about using the Bootstrap
                client-side css library to create <em>responsive</em> page designs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Additionally, we will start to create a unique web application that
                will become part of your professional portfolio. We will talk more
                about this in the coming weeks.
            </li>

            In chapter 2, you were shown how to apply styles with cascading style
            sheets (CSS). In chapter 3, the author uses the Bootstrap css library
            to dynamically style a web application as the window changes size or
            when a user launches a page on various mobile devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Developed for the Twitter project, Bootstrap has become the most popular
            CSS library. The patterns and elements are so widely used, it's part of
            Microsoft's template projects. I use Bootstrap in just about all of the
            coding projects that I deliver now. You'll want to spend some time in
            this chapter, and refer back to it for future projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Arguably, most web browsing now is done on mobile devices. These may
            vary widely in size and capabilities. Modern web pages should be able
            adapt to any device or window size which makes a request.
        </p>
        <p>
            Read the chapter and review the PowerPoint slides and try the recommended
            exercises, ex.3-1, and ex.3-2. This is a good opportunity to try changing
            a few things from what is written to get a good feel for how they work.

            This week we will also be introducing a new project. Think about the
            distinction between a web application and a web page. Start to think in
            terms of how you might define a web application. Your definition may
            continue to develop and evolve as you learn more.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this week, start with a survey of web sites and applications which
            you have visited. What is it about them that sets them apart? Do they
            provide helpful information? Is the content current? Is the page visually
            appealing? Does it load quickly?
        </p>
        <p>
            Consider the factors which are important to you, and start to develop
            ideas about the web project which you will build. This week you'll
            share some ideas on a discussion board, and provide thoughtful review
            feedback for others. Go to the discussion page to learn more.
