        <p>
            In Module 2, you will learn how to create a new ASP.NET Core MVC web app
            including all the skills you need to set up the folders and files for a
            simple MVC app that uses a controller to pass some data to a view that
            displays the data on a web page.
        </p>

        <p>
            The goals for this week:
            <ul>
                <li>start creating applications and using the Visual Studio IDE</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="alert">Practice (you will not hand these in) </h3>
        <p>
            Review the Chapter and the study notes and follow Exercise 2-1, p. 78-79, and Exercise 2-2, p. 79. (do not submit these to Canvas.)
        </p>

        <h3 class="alert"> Homework: Project 2-1 Build the Price Quotation app </h3>
        <p>
            For this project, you will build a single-page app like the one that's shown below. Start your project that's based
            on the MVC template or the empty template.
        </p>
        <p class="alert alert-info">
            <strong>Note: </strong> The .NET 6 templates include support for some big changes that came with C# version 9 (.NET 5)
            kand v.10 (.NET 6). When you select the .NET web app templates, either the empty template or MVC template, I recommend
            that you target .NET 3.1 (long-term support) for at least the first few projects so that the code more closely follows
            the descriptions in the book.<br />

        </p>
        <p>
            You can also use the files from Exercise 2-1 or 2-2 as a starting point.
            Save the files in a folder named, <strong>2-1_PriceQuotation</strong>. Be sure to add comments to your code.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <strong>Project 2-1 Specifications:</strong>
            <li>
                When the app starts, it should display the Price Quotation page with no subtotal or discount
                percent, and it should set the discount amount and total to $0.00.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the user enters a valid subtotal and discount percent and clicks the Calculate button, the
                app should calculate and display the discount amount and total.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the user enters invalid data and clicks the Calculate button, the app should display a summary
                of validation errors above the form.
            </li>
            <li>
                Here are the requirements for valid data:
                <ul>
                    <li>The sales price is required and must be a valid number that’s greater than 0.</li>
                    <li>The discount percent is required and must be a valid number from 0 to 100.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                If the user clicks the Clear link, the app should reset the form to how it was when the
                app first started.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the MVC pattern. To do that, create a model class that stores the subtotal and discount
                percent and calculates the discount amount and total. Make sure to bind that model to the
                Razor view that displays the Price Quotation page shown above.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use a Razor layout to store the html, head, and body elements.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use a custom CSS style sheet to style the HTML elements so they appear as shown above.
            </li>
            <li>
                Zip the folders and files and upload the zipped <strong>2-1_PriceQuotation</strong> folder
                to the Project Drop box in Canvas. Please use one of the zip programs like the Windows
                compressed zip program, WinZip, or 7-Zip that uses the .ZIP file extension. Please do not
                zip your files using the .RAR file extension.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            The due date is listed on the Canvas Calendar.
