            In Module 2, you will learn how to create a new ASP.NET Core MVC web app 
            including all the skills you need to set up the folders and files for a 
            simple MVC app that uses a controller to pass some data to a view that 
            displays the data on a web page.

            The goals for this week:
            <ul>
                <li>Follow the examples in the book for exercises 2-1, and 2-2. (Do not hand these in.) </li>
                <li>start creating applications and using the Visual Studio IDE</li>

        <h3 class="alert">Introduction to Web Programming </h3>
        <p>
            In this course you are going to be learning how to develop ASP.NET Core
            MVC web applications (web apps) using the Visual Studio IDE (Integrated
            Development Environment). An Integrated Development Environment is a set
            of tools which provide all of the functionality that you need for developing
            web apps. Visual Studio is the most popular IDE for ASP.NET Core web
            development. Microsoft provides a Community Edition of Visual Studio that
            is available for free and runs on Windows, as well as a free version that
            runs on macOS. The text also mentions a second program, the Visual Studio
            Code editor, that can be used to develop ASP.NET Core apps. However, please
            use the Visual Studio IDE as that is the program I will be using to grade
            your assignments.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="strg">Appendix A</span>, p. 727, in your text has instructions
            on how to download and install Visual Studio for Windows. <span class="strg">
                Appendix B
            </span>, p. 735, has instructions on how to download and install
            Visual Studio for macOS.

            An author will likely spend months writing and editing a textbook. The
            publishing and printing and distribution of the book will take more time. 
            If a book is used more than one time to teach a class, it is easy to imagine
            that a considerable amount of time has passed between the time a set of 
            instructions was developed and the time it is being read by a student. 
            Meanwhile, new releases and updates and patches to a software product may
            be published sometimes daily. For this reason, the installation instructions
            will almost always be out of date, but that does not mean not of value. 
            Use them as guidance, but we will be using the latest (stable) product 
            release. As of the day I am writing this, I have been using Visual Studio
            2022 for over a year, including the beta release and have no intention of
            reverting to an older build.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes the instructions you read may not match the current product build.
            Products may have incompatibility issues. Staying in sync with new technology
            means sometimes having to search for answers. This is the industry where
            we are and where we work. If you find a solution for an error you encounter
            on StackOverflow for instance, and it was written 4 years ago, it may be
            out of date. Sometimes research takes more than a single Google search.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Read the <span class="strg">Syllabus</span>. Be sure you understand 
                everything in the Syllabus. If any part is not clear, send me an 
                email through the Inbox and ask.
            </li>
            <li>Read Chapter 1 in the <strong>text</strong>.
            <li>Install <span class="strg">Visual Studio</span> on your computer.</li>
            <li>
                Download the <strong>student files</strong> for (1) the source code 
                for the book applications, (2) the starting points for the exercises 
                that are at the end of each chapter, and (3) the solutions to those
                exercises. 
                <!--The student files are located in the student download 
                folder at the top of the Modules tab.-->

            Once you have reviewed the PowerPoint and readings, use Visual Studio to 
            complete Exercise 1-1, to build and run the Guitar Shop app.
                <ul>
                    <li>Zip the folders and files and upload the zipped (not RAR!)
                    <strong>Ch01GuitarShop folder</strong> to the assignment in Canvas.</li>
                    <li>Note: You won't be making any changes to the Ch01GuitarShop 
                    files. The purpose of this assignment is to run the Guitar Shop 
                    app and test whether you've successfully installed the Visual 
                    Studio IDE and the source code for the textbook.</li>
