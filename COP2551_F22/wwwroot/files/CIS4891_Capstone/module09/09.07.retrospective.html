        <p>
            Delivering a software product involves a series of processes that ensure that 
            the software is developed, tested, deployed, and maintained successfully. 
        </p>
        <ul>
            Key processes include:
            <li>Requirements gathering and analysis</li>
            <li>Design and architecture</li>
            <li>Implementation and coding</li>
            <li>Testing</li>
            <li>Deployment</li>
            <li>Maintenance and support</li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The scope and methodology of each process will vary between projects and products. 
            Our intent was not to study all that is involved with each but to introduce the
            concepts and to recognize how they rely and build on each other and why.
        </p>
        <p>
            Processes will be tailored not only dependent on the project scope, but also based
            on the size and experience of the team. A large team with many moving parts will 
            almost certainly require more carefully planned processes, than a team of one or
            two. A team which has history of successful project deliveries will have collected
            experiences and process improvements to streamline steps over teams that are finding
            their way for the first several times.

        <p>
            It is sometimes difficult to separate a discussion on the product from the process.
            Your post will likely contain elements from both.
        </p>
        <p class="ic-flash-info">
            Please try and complete your initial post by Friday night before the due date.
            This is not a requirement, but rather a sincere request so that others
            can complete part 2.

        <h3 class="alert">Process Observations</h3>
        <p>
            In 2 or 3 paragraphs, Describe project experience including each phase of the SDLC
            and the project artifacts (design documents, requirements trace, test reports...).
            Which may have been new to you, which were helpful, which might have been more helpful
            on a larger scale project. Did you find that activities from earlier <em>phases</em>
            needed to be revisited or expanded in later <em>phases</em>?
        </p>

        <h3 class="alert">Project Lessons Learned</h3>
        <ul>
            Answer each of the following 4 questions.
            <li>
                <strong><em>What did you do right?</em></strong> When looking back over a
                project, it is easy to focus on the unfinished items on the to-do list or
                the mistakes which led to restarts and redo-s. For this, consider the pieces
                that came together well either because of planning, experience, inspiration
                or something else.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><em>What did you do wrong?</em></strong> This is sometimes the most
                obvious place to look for lessons learned and things to be avoided in the
                future.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong><em>Where were you lucky?</em></strong> This is one of my favorites.
                This is often left off of a project review, but it's one of the most
                important. The inclination is to celebrate these things, but don't. <em>Lucky</em>
                is often due to risks which may or may not have been identified which didn't materialize.
                This is where important lessons to be learned are often overlooked.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>
                    <em>
                        What would you change / what do you know now that you wish you knew
                        "then"?
                    </em>
                </strong> There are always more projects either already in progress
                or waiting to be started. The more tasks that you complete and projects you are
                involved with, the more value you will bring your project teams. One suggestion
                that I make to all (and especially new) engineers and developers is to keep a
                notebook. Write down every assignment you get and make a note in the margin how
                long you estimate the task will take. When it is finished mark how long it took.
                Over time, the difference between those numbers should get closer together. This
                is an important skill to learn. At first, you do not need to share this with anyone
                but soon, you will be asked to estimate your work. It's a good way to get started.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h2 class="alert">Part 2. Response  (25 pts)</h2>
        <p>
            This is difficult to coordinate and relies on as many students to complete
            part 1 as possible. In an ideal situation, I would ask that you read, and optionally
            comment on all of the other posts in the thread. As a relatively small class, that
            is not really a large task, and would be beneficial to all, however since that
            introduces dependencies that you and I cannot control, instead I will ask you
            to read as many as are available and provide constructive feedback to at least
            3 other student posts.
