        <h2 class="alert">Product Testing</h2>
        <p>
            Testing activities should take place throughout the lifecycle
            of a project. From the start of requirements gathering, considerations
            for testability, and test planning need to be considered. As the 
            product matures, products and artifacts are tested against the 
            decomposed requirements as well as the customer's originating 
            requirements and objectives.
        </p>
        <p>
            For project management, primary consideration needs to be given
            to the cost of defect correction over the life cycle of the product.
            The cost of detecting and fixing errors increases substantially 
            as the project advances from requirements through design through
            implementation and on to delivery and maintenance.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this reason, even design artifacts are reviewed by the test
            team for correctness and measured against requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's less expensive to correct a design before it has been implemented,
            and less expensive to fix a code method before it has been integrated.
            If the product reaches acceptance testing, substantial costs are likely
            incurred to correct even minor defects.
        </p>
        <p class="ic-flash-info">
            <strong>Escapes</strong> or Escaped Defects are defects (bugs) that
            are identified after a product release.
        </p>
        <p>
            Costs of <strong>escapes</strong> may go beyond the cost of correcting
            them. Repairing a company's brand reputation can be crippling.
        </p>
        <h3>Unit Testing</h3>
        <p>
            An important part of development should include unit testing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unit testing is a software testing technique in which individual units 
            or components of a software application are tested in isolation from the 
            rest of the application. The purpose of unit testing is to validate that 
            each unit or component of the software is functioning correctly and to 
            identify any defects or errors in the code.
        </p>
        <p>
            A unit in this context typically refers to a single function, method, or 
            class. The unit is tested by providing it with inputs and evaluating its 
            outputs to verify that it produces the expected result. The test cases are 
            typically automated, allowing for efficient and consistent testing.
        </p>
        <p>
            How big a unit or compenent needs to be is subjective, but usually includes
            every method in a class, including the constructor. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Developers write unit tests as they are developing and the result is a 
            robust library of tests which can be autonomously and automatically run
            throughout the development process. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Writing and continuously running these tests are low cost insurance that 
            later <em>corrections</em> don't result in errors to previously working 
            code.
        </p>
        <h3>Acceptance Testing</h3>
        <p>
            Near product delivery, <em>final</em> testing may be known as different names
            and may take on different appearances.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Factory Acceptance Testing (FAT)</strong> involves preparing and 
            repetitively running through a set of formal tests intended to demonstrate
            that requirements have been met. This set of testing is usually done internally
            to prepare for <strong>Customer Acceptance Testign (CAT)</strong>, which is
            often performed or witnessed by the customer or a representative.
        </p>
        <h3>Validation and Verification (V &amp; V)</h3>
        <p>
            Measurement against requirements can also be categorized with different focus
            and strategies. The decomposed, detailed requirements are individually
            <strong>Validated</strong> to show that they are passing the focused tests 
            built specifically to their detail, and the system operation is also 
            <strong>Verified</strong> either in the actual or a simulation of the intended
            environment under <em>normal</em> operating conditions.
        </p>
        <p>Another way of considering this:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Validation - <em>Did we build it right?</em></li>
            <li>Verification - <em>Did we build the right thing?</em></li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 class="alert">Test Readiness Review</h3>
        <p>
            In most product deliveries, prior to formal acceptance testing, a product team
            will conduct a Test Readiness Review (TRR). As the name suggests, this process 
            ensures that the software product is ready for testing, and identifies any potential 
            issues that may affect the quality of the testing. 
        </p>
        <p>
            For this review, the requirements, as well as the test plan and test environment are
            reviewed for readiness, including hardware, software, and network resources. The test
            data is assembled and checked for completeness, the test cases and scripts, and acceptance
            criteria should have been reviewed to ensure they cover the requirements to be tested. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The ojective of the review, is a risk assessment to ensure that everything is prepared.
        </p>
        <h3>Requirements Traceability Matrix</h3>
        <p>
            A requirements traceability matrix (RTM) is a document that is used to track and manage 
            the relationship between requirements and other aspects of a software development project. 
            The purpose of an RTM is to ensure that all requirements are met, and to provide traceability 
            from the requirements to other elements of the project, such as design, development, testing, 
            and deployment.
        </p>
        <p>
            An RTM typically consists of a table that lists the requirements and associated information, 
            such as the requirement ID, description, priority, and status. The matrix also includes 
            columns for tracing the requirement to other elements of the project, such as test cases, 
            design documents, and code modules. The matrix may include additional information, such as 
            the name of the person responsible for the requirement, the date the requirement was added 
            or changed, and any comments or notes related to the requirement.
        </p>
        <p>
            The RTM helps ensure that all requirements are addressed and that they are properly tested 
            and validated. It also provides a way to track changes to requirements throughout the project, 
            helping to ensure that the project stays on track and that all stakeholders are aware of the 
            project status.
        </p>

        <h3 class="alert">Project Closeout</h3>
        <p>
            By now, you have seen the different phases of the SDLC and may be wondering
            or realizing that that Testing and even product delivery is not the end of the
            life cycle. In most cases, product handoff will lead to a period of maintenance
            and support and often continued development for subsequent product feature 
            releases and updates. Often, this may be defined as a new project.
        </p>
        <p>
            In any case, it still defines the ending of one phase of development and perhaps
            the start of another, and as you have seen, is usually accompanied by another 
            review. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Even in small iterations such as sprints, there are often two separate reviews,
            the review with the stakeholders, to measure completeness against planned delivery,
            and an internal retrospective which captures lessons learned for process improvement.
            When conducted with this in mind, these reviews serve to improve the team, the 
            processes, and the business unit for the next effort. There are business considerations
            and activities associated with the project closeout, but don't overlook the opportunity
            to capture ideas and thoughts from the team before they are released and reassigned
            to another project.
