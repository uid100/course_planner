            This course is about understanding and following processes. There are assumptions
            of some prior knowledge of programming and building applications, but the focus 
            has really been the design artifacts and the development process.
        </p>
        <p>
            We are hopeful that you have built something that you are proud to have your
            name on, but you will notice that there has not been much (if any) emphasis on
            code review or quantitative test results. I am interested in seeing what you 
            have built, but I am more interested in the development of the product.

            Everyone hopes to have a <em>market-ready</em> app that is going to disrupt the
            industry with life-altering content. That is not the expectation. Recall that an
            objective at the end of each sprint using scrum methodology is a potentially
            shippable product. Shippable does not always mean <em>market-ready</em> sometimes
            it means <em>something is ready and maybe preliminary testing can take place.</em>
            Or maybe <em>it doesn't meet all of the requirements (yet), but it's enough to
            show the customer so that they can see product direction and progress.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Even <em>complete</em> products which meet all requirements and are fully tested
            often still have a backlog of proposed or planned features that are not included
            in a particular release.
        </p>
        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>
            <em>Then what is the point?</em>

            Prepare a presentation of at least 5 but no more than 7 minutes to demonstrate the
            end state of your project, and progress made toward that goal. Use a stopwatch, there
            will be points off for under or over the time requirements.
            <li>
                The presentation may be using PointPoint slides with slide narration on each slide.
                Insructions for doing this are easy to find online. A benefit of this approach is that
                each slide can be separately recorded and pieced together.<br />
                After creating your presentation, select File > Export > Create a video. Select the 
                lowest quality that maintains the detail you need to keep the file smaller.
            </li>
            <li>
                Another alternative is to record this on your computer. There are many tools available
                for doing this. Zoom is available to you and is relatively easy one to use for making
                videos which incude running demonstrations on your computer.
            </li>
            <li>
                There are other tools available also. You may investigate and select from others.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <ol>
            Your presentation should describe:
            <li>code and architecture walk-through</li>
            <li>
                the project experience including each phase of the SDLC and the project artifacts
                (design documents, requirements trace, test reports...)
            </li>
            <li>product demonstration</li>
        </ol>
