        <p>
            In Module 2, we discussed RESTful APIs, what they are, and how
            they can be used to serve data, independent of a 'View.'
        </p>
        <p>
            You can review that <a title="REST APIs" style="color:navy;"

        </p>
        <p>
            In the last module, you described data entities and diagramed
            the data class models for them.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this step, start to build the data I/O structure for your
            project.

        <ul style="margin-left:5%;">
            At the end of this module, you will be able to:
            <li>
                <strong>Describe</strong> an n-Tier solution architecture
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Demonstrate</strong> data delivery through the use
                of an API

        <h3 class="alert">Data-centric design</h3>
        <p>
            A data-centric approach to solution programming is an approach that 
            places a strong emphasis on the importance of data in designing, 
            developing, and implementing software solutions. This approach focuses 
            on the organization, management, and utilization of data to meet 
            specific business needs or solve particular problems.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a data-centric approach, the design of the solution is based on a 
            thorough understanding of the data and the relationships between 
            different data elements. The approach also involves identifying the 
            various types of data required for the solution, defining data models 
            and schemas, and selecting the appropriate data storage and retrieval 
            mechanisms.
        </p>
        <p>
            The data-centric approach recognizes that data is the most valuable 
            asset in most organizations and applications. As such, it should be 
            treated as a primary consideration in the development of software 
            solutions. By prioritizing data in this way, the approach helps to 
            ensure that solutions are optimized for data storage, management, 
            and analysis, ultimately leading to better decision-making and 
            improved business outcomes.
