        <h2 class="alert">UI/UX and Wireframe Diagrams</h2>
        <p>
            The graphical user interface (GUI) is what the user sees and how they
            interact with your application. How well it is designed will have a
            direct impact on how easy it is to use and understand. Combined with
            the implementation and the functionality, this shapes the user experience
            (UX).
        </p>
        <p>
            Even a well-designed interface that is intuitive and attractive can
            frustrate a user if the implementation is not correct or the server
            response is unreasonably slow or the workflow is not logical.
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of the design phase, create wireframe diagrams to illustrate
            the logical workflow for the use to interact.
        </p>
        <p>
            Wireframe drawings are not intended to be <em>pretty</em> finalized
            documents, they generally do not include color schemes or finished
            images or font choices. What they do show is approximate location
            of input and output elements.
        </p>
        <h3>Purpose</h3>
        <div class="ic-flash-info">
            <h4>Important</h4>
            <p>
                the purpose of design documents is to communicate a concept and
                to support logical peer review.

            A wireframe sketch can be a very useful tool in clarifying logical
            workflows and even identifying logic errors.

        <h2 class="alert">User Interface Design Principles</h2>

        <h3>Keep the interface simple.</h3>
        <p>
            The best interfaces are almost invisible to the user. They avoid
            unnecessary elements and are clear in the language they use on
            labels and in messaging.
        </p>
        <p>
            There was a time when every software release needed user training.
            A measure of success might include an interface that is familiar
            to the user, the first time they see it.
        </p>

        <h3>Create consistency and use common UI elements.</h3>
        <p>
            By using common elements in your UI, users feel more comfortable
            and are able to get things done more quickly. It is also important
            to create patterns in language, layout and design throughout the
            site to help facilitate efficiency. Once a user learns how to do
            something, they should be able to transfer that skill to other
            parts of the site.
        </p>
        <p>
            If a team or teams of engineers are working on different areas
            of the interface, or the application is being integrated into
            another operational context, care should be taken to ensure a
            familiar <em>look and feel.</em>
        </p>

        <h3>Be purposeful in page layout.</h3>
        <p>
            Consider the spatial relationships between items on the page
            and structure the page based on importance. Careful placement
            of items can help draw attention to the most important pieces
            of information and can aid scanning and readability.
        </p>

        <h3>Strategically use color and texture.</h3>
        <p>
            You can direct attention toward or redirect attention away
            from items using color, light, contrast, and texture to your
            advantage.
        </p>

        <h3>Use typography to create hierarchy and clarity.</h3>
        <p>
            Carefully consider how you use typeface. Different sizes,
            fonts, and arrangement of the text to help increase scanability,
            legibility and readability.
        </p>

        <h3>Make sure that the system communicates whats happening.</h3>
        <p>
            Always inform your users of location, actions, changes in
            state, or errors. The use of various UI elements to communicate
            status and, if necessary, next steps can reduce frustration for
            your user.
        </p>

        <h3>Think about the defaults.</h3>
        <p>
            By carefully thinking about and anticipating the goals people
            bring to your site, you can create defaults that reduce the
            burden on the user. This becomes particularly important when it
            comes to form design where you might have an opportunity to
            have some fields pre-chosen or filled out.
        </p>
        <p>
            These values may be constants or may be calculated by the
            application and be context-aware.
