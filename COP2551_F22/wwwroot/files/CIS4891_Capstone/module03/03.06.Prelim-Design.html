        <h3>Preliminary Design Documents</h3>
        <p>
            This week, migrate your project description from the last module into a GitHub
            repository and create and include these preliminary design document artifacts
            <ul>
                <li>Description</li>
                <li>Wireframe diagram(s)</li>
                <li>Solution architecture diagram</li>
                <li>User Stories</li>
                <li>Initial Use Cases</li>
                <li>Use Case Diagram</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <div id="github">
        <h2 class="alert">GitHub</h2>
        <p>
            Create a public repository in GitHub. The name should be helpful in describing
            your application (not "Student_capstone_project" or "Project_1")
        </p>
        <p>
            Add a brief (1-line) description for your application. You can edit this using
            the gear icon next to <strong>About</strong> on the front page of the repository.
        </p>
        <p>
            Add some meaningful topical keywords. These can be relevant to the solution domain
            (e-commerce, healthcare, fitness, ...) or to the technology you are using (mvc,
            javascript, api, sql-server, ...)
        </p>
        <p>
            Add a Readme (README.md) file. This file uses Markdown format and becomes the
            front page for your project as a place to collect and reference your design docs.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </div>

    <div id="readme">
        <h2 class="alert">README.md</h2>
        <p>
            Your README file should be organized and contain logical headings such as Overview,
            User Stories, Use Cases
        </p>
        <p>
            Copy and paste your project description from the last module, format as Markdown
            and edit as needed. It may be appropriate to add the document to a <b>documents</b>
            folder within the repository and only include select pieces of it, sufficient to
            describe your project to visitors.
        </p>
    </div> <!-- #readme -->

    <div id="wireframe">
        <h2 class="alert">Wireframe Sketches</h2>
        <p>
            Create wireframe <em>concept</em> drawings of your application to communicate an
            <em>at-a-glance</em> idea of your vision for the solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            These diagrams are not expected to be <em>polished</em> or <em>finished</em> 
            drawings. They should provide a logical view of the user's typical workflow
            from one screen to the next. Ideas and logic are important, artwork is not.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use the drawing tool of your choice. My preference for this is the <em>sketchy</em>
            template in the free tool: Pencil Project from Evolus.
        </p>
        <p>
            Draw.io is another good (free) choice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Export your drawings as Jpeg images and save them to an <b>images</b> folder
            in your repository and link them to your README.
        </p>

        </div> <!-- #submission -->
        1. wire-frame sketches designs of your pages. Your pages should have notes indicating logical navigation sequence
        and logical flow of interface elements. Indicate whether there are any default form values, default actions, and
        element ordering (can you tab through the items?)

        2. project hosted in Github with README.md containing the following elements, with headers:

        - Concept description,
        - Database diagram(s),
        - Wire-frames (label as DRAFT)

        _**submit the URL to your project**_
