        <h3>Preliminary Design Documents</h3>
        <p>
            This week, migrate your project description from the last module into a GitHub
            repository and create and include these preliminary design document artifacts
            <ul>
                <li>(10 pts) Description and README</li>
                <li>(10 pts) Solution architecture diagram</li>
                <li>(20 pts) Wireframe diagram(s)</li>
                <li>(20 pts) User Stories</li>
                <li>(20 pts) Initial Use Cases</li>
                <li>(20 pts) Use Case Diagram</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            The design documents in your readme will tell a visitor a story and communicate
            your vision for your project application.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <div id="github">
        <h2 class="alert">GitHub</h2>
        <p>
            Create a public repository in GitHub. The name should be helpful in describing
            your application (not "Student_capstone_project" or "Project_1")
        </p>
        <p>
            Add a brief (1-line) description for your application. You can edit this using
            the gear icon next to <strong>About</strong> on the front page of the repository.
        </p>
        <p>
            Add some meaningful topical keywords. These can be relevant to the solution domain
            (e-commerce, healthcare, fitness, ...) or to the technology you are using (mvc,
            javascript, api, sql-server, ...)
        </p>
        <p>
            Add a Readme (README.md) file. This file uses Markdown format and becomes the
            front page for your project as a place to collect and reference your design docs.
        </p>
        <h3 id="resources">Markdown Resources</h3>

        <p>&nbsp;</p>
    </div>

    <div id="readme">
        <h2 class="alert">README.md</h2>
        <p>
            Your README file should be organized and contain logical headings such as Overview,
            User Stories, Use Cases
        </p>
        <p>
            Copy and paste your project description from the last module, format as Markdown
            and edit as needed. It may be appropriate to add the document to a <b>documents</b>
            folder within the repository and only include select pieces of it, sufficient to
            describe your project to visitors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Deconstruct your application into multiple smaller components. Consider: database,
            data access API, presentation layer, admin application, others? Create a simple 
            architecture (block) diagram indicating the different components and interfaces
            (links) between them. Keep this simple, not a lot of detail required for this.
        </p>
        <p>
            Save your component drawing as an image file and add it to your README.md. Search
            for "GitHub markdown cheatsheet" for hints to adding images (and headings and 
            table of contents) to your README file.
        </p>
    </div> <!-- #readme -->

    <div id="wireframe">
        <h2 class="alert">Wireframe Sketches</h2>
        <p>
            Create wireframe <em>concept</em> drawings of your application to communicate an
            <em>at-a-glance</em> idea of your vision for the solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your pages should have notes indicating logical navigation sequence and logical 
            flow of interface elements. Indicate whether there are any default form values, 
            default actions, and element ordering (will the user tab through the items?)
        </p>
        <p>
            These diagrams are not expected to be <em>polished</em> or <em>finished</em> 
            drawings. They should provide a logical view of the user's typical workflow
            from one screen to the next. Ideas and logic are important, artwork is not.
        </p>
        <p>
            Use the drawing tool of your choice. My preference for this is the <em>sketchy</em>
            template in the free tool: Pencil Project from Evolus.
        </p>
        <p>
            Draw.io is another good (free) choice.
        </p>
        <p>
            Export your drawings as Jpeg images and save them to an <b>images</b> folder
            in your repository and link them to your README.
        </p>
        <p>
            You may create as many sketches here as make sense to tell the story. One may
            be enough.
        </p>
    </div> <!-- #wireframe -->

    <div id="user-stories">
        <h2 class="alert">User Stories</h2>
        <p>
            Create (at least 5) User Stories to describe how the application is intended to be
            used.
        </p>
        <p>
            The use-cases should be formatted correctly and consistently.
        </p>
        <p>
            Add these with a section heading to your README.
        </p>
    </div> <!-- #user-stories-->

    <div id="use-cases">
        <h2 class="alert">Use-Cases</h2>
        <p>
            Write (at least 5) Use-Cases and add them to your README. These may be in
            separate documents with links in the README, or written directly in the 
            README.md file. 
        </p>
        <p>
            There is flexibility on formatting here. There are many example templates
            online. You can use either a tabular format or paragraphs with subheadings.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Use-Cases should describe the primary usage for the application.
        </p>
    </div> <!-- #use-cases -->

    <div id="use-case-diagram">
        <h2 class="alert">(UML) Use Case Diagram</h2>
        <p>
            Add a use-case diagram to your README. The diagram should indicate system
            boundary, actors, use-cases, links between actors and use-cases. Use the
            correct symbols for the UML specification.
        </p>
        <p>
            The correct use-cases should be included in the diagram (This might not 
            inlude all of them)
        </p>
        <p>
            Be sure to save as jpeg or other common supported image format. Add a 
            heading to the README. 
        </p>
    </div> <!-- #use-case-diagram -->

    <div id="submission">
        <h2 class="alert">Submission</h2>
        <p>
            Add the URL link to your project repository (not to the README.md). The 
            README docment displays by default when the repository is visited.
        </p>
        <p>
            The README should contain
            <ul>
                <li>Concept description</li>
                <li>Wire-frames (labeled as DRAFT)</li>
                <li>Requirements
                    <ul>
                        <li>User Stories</li>
                        <li>Use-Cases</li>
                        <li>Use-Case Diagram</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Create your GitHub repository to contain your design documents and the new
            content you will be creating. Use the content pages that I created in this 
            module to get you started. These are not exhaustive. In addition to these,
            combine with other online resources and your own experience to create these
            design artifacts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Be sure to check the rubric for the requirements before you submit your work.
        </p>
        <p>
            In the text entry, enter the link to your project README. The content there
            should be easy to find and review. In the next module, you'll be adding to
            it and peer reviewing one another's work.
