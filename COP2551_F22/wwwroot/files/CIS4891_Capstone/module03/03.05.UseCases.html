        <h3>[Top-Level] User Requirements</h3>

        <p>
            Identifying, decomposing and managing formal requirements is an important
            part of software engineering.
        </p>
        <p>
            System requirements are often supported by <b>User Stories</b>, <b>Use-Cases,</b>
            and <b>Use-Case Diagrams</b>. Don't confuse these. They sound similar but it is
            important to be able to explain how they are similar and to distinguish between
            them.

    <div id="user-stories" style="padding: 20px;">
        <h2 class="alert">User Stories</h2>
        <p>
            The process of developing system requirements usually begins with identifying
            the user need for a solution or developing a problem description.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is usually expressed as <b>user stories.</b>
        </p>
        <div class="ic-flash-info">
            The <em>user story</em> is a simple statement expressing a user or customer's
            need or desire for a solution. It should be expressed from the user's perspective
        </div>
        <p>
            The user story follows a standard 3-part format, indicating:
            <ol>
                <li>role</li>
                <li>request</li>
                <li>result</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
        <p>
            For example,
            <ul>
                <li><b>As a</b> potential customer</li>
                <li><b>I need</b> to see customer reviews</li>
                <li><b>So that</b> I can make an informed product selection</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <b>User stories</b> are usually written in collaboration with a customer or
            end user and express operational needs from the user's point of view.
        </p>
        <p>
            These are simple expressions and during the initial phase of <em>
                capturing
                originating requirements
            </em> as many of these should be gathered as possible
            to describe the goals of the system.
        </p>
        <p>
            This standard format is easily recognizable and easy to follow.
            <ul>
                <li><b>As a</b> <em>[Persona]</em></li>
                <li><b>I want/need</b> <em>[Functionality]</em></li>
                <li><b>So that</b> <em>[Desired Outcome]</em></li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Notice that sometimes the solution the user is requesting may not be the
            the best solution for the desired outcome. Also, understanding the user's
            role and intended operational environment is essential to developing a
            usable and useful solution.
        </p>
        <p>
            Formally, <b><i>User Stories</i></b> should include acceptance criteria
            specifying starting condition, action, and demonstrated objective. This
            is not always included at this stage.

        <h2 class="alert">Use Cases</h2>
        <div id="use-case-definition" class="ic-flash-info" style="font-style:italic;">
            <p>
                In simple terms, a use case is an account of how a person who uses
                a certain process will achieve a goal. In technical terms, it is the
                description of the interaction between system and actors. The product
                of this process is a document containing all the steps followed by a
                user to achieve a goal.
            </p>
            <p>
                (from: https://www.digitalnatives.hu/blog/user-story-vs-use-case/)
            </p>
        </div> <!-- #use-case-definition -->
        <p>
            A Use-Case is a textual description of how a person will use a
            system to accomplish an objective.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many template examples for Use Cases. Although these may differ,
            and may be tailored to meet a particular need or audience, these will generally
            include:
            <ul>
                <li><b>Brief description</b> (or title)</li>
                <li><b>The [relevant] system</b></li>
                <li><b>The actor(s)</b> including those initiating or responding to events</li>
                <li><b>Scenario</b> usually will include the pre-existing conditions and
                (all) relevant action sequences</li>
                <li><b>Expected result</b></li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>
            Use cases can be quite detailed and should describe all of the actions and 
            measurable results required to meet the user requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            The <em>Use-Case</em> may derive from one or more <em>User Stories</em>.

        <h2 class="alert">A Graphical Summary</h2>
        <p>
            The <strong>Unified Modeling Language (UML)</strong> is a formal standard
            (currently v2.5) specification which defines 14 types of engineering diagrams,
            7 <em>behavioral,</em> and 7 <em>structural</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <img 
                 style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"

                 alt="UML2.5 Diagram Overview" />
        </p>

        <p>
            One of these formal diagram definitions is the <strong>use case diagram</strong>
            which is a graphical representation of a set of use-cases depicting their
            interaction with actors either inside or outside of the system boundary.
        </p>
        <p>
            <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"

        <p>
            Notice 
            <ul>
            <li>
                The system boundary indicating which activities take place inside 
                and outside of the system. The system boundary is represented by
                a box around the use case(s)
            </li>
            <li>
                The actors, in this case all of them are indicated outside of the 
                system boundary. The actors are a generalized persona. If multiple
                instances of a role are expected, only one <em>actor</em> is 
                indicated to represent that role. Actors do not need to be users,
                they may represent external systems or APIs. They are represented
                by a stick figure
            </li>
            <li>
                Straight lines are drawn indicating interaction between actor and
                use case.
            </li>
            <li>
                Relevant use cases are represented in the diagram. All use cases
                associated with the system do not need to be included in the diagram
                to make the diagram useful.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use cases are represented with a labeled oval shape.
            </li>
            <li>
                The use case diagram is <em>not</em> an activity diagram or flow chart.
                Activity is not indicated by "flow" lines between use cases.
            </li>
