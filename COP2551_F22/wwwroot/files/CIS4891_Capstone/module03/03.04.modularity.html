            <p>
                An important step in building a complex system is decomposing
                large, complex systems into smaller, easier to construct subsystems,
                modules, or components
            </p>
        </div> <!-- #activity -->
        <p>
            In all of the programming courses you've taken and languages you've learned, you have
            practiced the process and <em>art</em> of writing modular code, using objects and
            methods, and library modules and even inter-process communication. (IPCs)
        </p>
        <p>
            Start to deconstruct the functionality of your application into manageable pieces.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <div id="abstraction-and-decomposition" style="padding:20px;">
        <h2 class="alert">Abstraction and Decomposition</h2>
        <p>
            Take a moment to consider the structure and functionality of your application. How
            many ways could it be deconstructed into smaller architectural and functional pieces?
        </p>
        <p>
            Using an <em>n-Tiered</em> architecture model, the presentation layer, the data
            access layer, the business logic layer are constructed as separate entities. Are
            there other components or subsystems that could be employed to simplify your design
            and implementation?
        </p>
        <p>
            As an example, a separate, standalone application could be used to perform select,
            <em>priveleged</em> functions, that are not available to a web-enabled user application
            reducting the authentication requirements. If the web app doesn't have the capability
            to perform certain actions on a given data-space, the security requirements are eased
            whereas the admin functions for the same data set might only be available to a desktop
            application installed on a particular workstation.

                Abstraction vs Decomposition
            </a>

        <div id="stackoverflow" style="padding:30px;">
            <p>
                Both concepts (<strong>abstraction and decomposition</strong> are analysis & design
                basic techniques. There are interrelated and normally used together during software
                development. We use them even though we are not always aware of it. Deeper understanding
                of these concepts helps to be more accurate and effective in A&D.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Abstraction</strong> in general is a process of consciously ignoring some
                aspects of a subject under analysis in order to better understand other aspects of
                it. In other words, it kind of <em>simplification</em> of a subject. In software in
                particular, analysis &amp; design are all about abstraction.
            </p>
            <p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        When you model your DB, you ignore UI and behavior of your system and
                        concentrate only on DB structure
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When you model your architecture, you concentrate on high-level modules
                        and their relationships and ignore their internal structure
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Each UML diagram for example gives a special, limited view on the system,
                        therefore focusing on a single aspect and ignoring all other (sequences
                        abstract objects and messages, deployment abstracts network and servers,
                        use cases abstract system users and their interactions with a system, etc)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Writing source code in any programming language requires a lot of
                        abstraction - programmers abstract app's functionality using limited set
                        of language constructs
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Decomposition</strong> is an application of the old good principle
                &quot;divide and conquer&quot; to software development. It is a technique of
                classifying, structuring and grouping complex elements in order to end up with
                more atomic ones, organized in certain fashion and easier to manage. In all
                phases there are lots of examples:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        functional decomposition of a complex process to hierarchical structure
                        of smaller sub-processes and activities
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        high-level structure of an complex application to 3 tiers - UI, logic and data
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Class structure of a complex domain
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        namespaces as a common concept of breaking a global scope into several local ones
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        UML packages are a direct use of decomposition on the model level - use packages
                        to organize your model
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Abstraction is somehow more generic principle than decomposition, kind of
                &quot;father of all principles&quot; :)
