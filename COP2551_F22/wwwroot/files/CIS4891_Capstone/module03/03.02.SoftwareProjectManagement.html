        <h2 class="alert">Managing Software Projects</h2>
        <p>
            In module 1, we talked about what a project is and a little about
            the linear sequence of management phases.
        </p>
        <p>
            Traditionally, these management phases were linked closely to development tasks.
            In a perfect situation, this is a very good approach. Even better, if you know
            everything about a project, how long each activity will take, and have assurance
            that nothing <em>unexpected</em> could or will happen when launching a project
            and laying out the plan, and monitoring and tracking progress.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course the ideal situation doesn't exist, so managing projects consists
            as much of reporting progress as dealing with obstacles along the way.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Why does it matter?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Project management is ultimately focused on three things, schedule, budget, and
            scope. A project that misses schedule or goes over budget, or doesn't meet
            requirements, not only disappoints a customer, but can be very costly to
            an organizations brand reputation and have far-reaching impacts.
        </p>
        <div class="ic-flash-info">
            Sometimes called <strong>The Iron Triangle</strong> or the <strong>
                triple
                constraint
            </strong>. If you imagine that these three (time, cost, scope)
            are laid out on a triangle, you cannot change one without impacting another.
            If you add requirements, you have to add time or cost, if an activity takes
            longer, it almost certainly costs more. If the customer wants it faster
            and cheaper, then something else has to be cut from the delivery.

            <img 
                 style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" 
                 src="/courses/456310/files/46187484/preview" 
                 alt="triangle of project constraints" width="558" height="312" />
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>"This is just a classroom activity, what does this have to do with us?"</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            As a student, you are certainly constrained by schedule. There is limited
            time in the semester, and that can't be extended.
        </p>
        <p> 
            Also cost, if you recognize that budget can be translated to hours, there 
            are only so many hours in a day and sleeping and eating are also necessary.
        </p>
        <p>
            That just leaves scope as the variable to be controlled. You can plan for 
            a very complex, market ready software application with a long set of 
            requirements, but with limited resources and fixed delivery dates, sometimes 
            we need to defer capabilities for later. Don't hesitate to add <em>wish-list</em>
            or future capabilities to your plan.
        </p>
        <p>
            These <em>backlog</em> items are good to have, but keep your deliveries
            realistic, keep your progress consistent, and don't procrastinate.
        </p>
        <p>
            In past classes, at the end of a project when students have presented their
            results and lessons learned, one of the common regrets I have heard is,
            "I wish I hadn't waited to get started."
