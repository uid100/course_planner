        <p>
            You have seen that design documents are are useful for communication and
            negotiation among stakeholders and for elaboration and clarification of a 
            product. As the design evolves, the solution is formed and having a shared
            understanding of objectives and approaches is essential to success.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this module we will develop the conceptual data design from the perspective
            of both the database and software implementation.
        </p>
        <ul>
            Consider:
            <li>What is a conceptual database design</li>
            <li>What is an entity</li>
            <li>What is an attribute</li>
            <li>What is a relationship</li>
            <li>What is cardinality</li>
        </ul>
    </div> <!-- #background -->

        <p>
            While developing your initial concept document, I asked you to think about
            the data that your application will consume, store, process, and output.
            Recall from the REST API discussion that there may be multiple visualizations
            or representations of the data.

        <h3>ERD (50 points)</h3>
        <p>
            Develop a Chen-notation Entity Relationship Diagram (ERD). This is a different
            notation than the <em>Crowsfoot</em> notation which is also popular. Refer
            to the reference resources provided in this module.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your diagram will identify the entities, attributes, relationships, and
            cardinality relevant to your project.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>UML Class Diagram (50 points)</h3>
        <p>
            For part 2, develop your initial class diagram to show the implementation of
            the ERD as software classes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each class should include the attributes, the attribute type, visibility,
            and methods with return type, parameters, and visibility as well as any
            relationships among other objects.
        </p>

        <p>
            You can use any drawing tool for this activity. I suggest, and often use
            the free online draw.io tool. Remember if you choose this, that the tool
            saves working files as XML format (.drawio) and you'll need to <strong>Export</strong>
            your drawings to a common image format (I recommend jpeg) to render them
            in your GitHub README file.
        </p>

        <h3>Submissions</h3>
        <p>
            Add both the ERD and Class Diagram(s) to your GitHub repo and README file
            with corresponding headers in the file. Also update the table of contents
            in the README so they can be linked quickly in the file.
        </p>
        <p>
            If the content in your README is appropriately organized with hierarchical
            headers, adding a table of contents is easy to do. Most Markdown cheatsheets
            will have instructions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Enter the link to your GitHub repository when the README is ready for review.
