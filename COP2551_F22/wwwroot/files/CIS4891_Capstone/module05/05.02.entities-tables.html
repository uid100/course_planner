        Entities, classes, and tables.
    </h3>
    <p>
        Entities are the <em>things</em> in your application. Entities
        are typically stored in database tables with records in rows and 
        attributes in columns, and related to eachother using keys in the 
        table.
    </p>
    <p>
        Data models are implemented as classes in Object-Oriented Programming
        with attributes as fields or properties and behavior and relationships
        as methods.
    </p>
    </div>
    <div id="classes-and-tables" style="padding:20px;">
        <h2 class="alert">Classes and Tables</h2>
        <p>
            In software development, classes and database tables are both used to represent 
            entities or objects in a system. Classes are used to represent objects and their 
            behavior, while database tables are used to represent entities and their attributes.
        </p>
        <p>
            The relationship between classes and database tables is often referred to as the 
            "object-relational mapping" (ORM). ORM is the process of mapping objects in an 
            object-oriented programming language to database tables in a relational database 
            management system (RDBMS).
        </p>
        <p>
            In general, each class in an object-oriented programming language corresponds to 
            a table in a relational database. The class attributes are represented as columns 
            in the table, and the class methods are represented as stored procedures or 
            functions in the database.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, let's say you have a class called "Customer" in your software 
            application. This class might have attributes such as "name", "email", and 
            "address". In a database, you might have a table called "Customers" with columns 
            for "name", "email", and "address". The data in the table would correspond to 
            instances of the "Customer" class in the software.
        </p>
        <p>
            The relationship between classes and database tables is important because it 
            allows developers to store and retrieve data in a structured way that can be 
            easily queried and manipulated. By mapping classes to database tables, developers 
            can use the power of a relational database management system to efficiently store 
            and manage data in their applications.
        </p>

    <div id="entities" style="padding:20px;">
        <h2 class="alert">Entities</h2>
        <p>
            Entities are a fundamental concept in object-oriented programming (OOP) design.
            In OOP, an entity is an object or concept in the problem domain that the software
            system being designed needs to represent and manipulate.
        </p>
        <p>
            Entities can be represented in OOP design as classes, which encapsulate data and
            behavior related to the entity. For example, in a banking system, a "Customer"
            entity might be represented as a class with properties such as name, address, and
            account information, and methods to deposit or withdraw money.
        </p>
        <p>
            OOP design typically emphasizes the use of entities to represent real-world objects
            and concepts in the software system being developed. By using entities as the
            building blocks of the design, the resulting software system can be more modular,
            extensible, and maintainable, since changes to an entity's behavior or data can be
            encapsulated within the entity's class without affecting the rest of the system.
            Additionally, entities can be composed of other entities, creating a hierarchy of
            objects that can be modeled and represented in the software.
        </p>
        <p>
            The concept of entities is related to the design of databases, which are used to
            store and manage structured data.
        </p>
        <p>
            As with OOP, database design begins with an entity refererence to a real-world
            object or concept that is represented by a table in the database. The attributes
            of the entity are the columns of the table, and each row in the table represents
            a specific instance of the entity.
        </p>
        <p>
            For example, in a database for an e-commerce website, the entity "Product" might
            be represented by a table with columns for the product's name, description, price,
            and other attributes. Each row in the table would represent a specific product that
            is available for purchase on the website.
        </p>
        <p>
            When considering the design approach to a software solution, begin with identifying
            the associated entities, those real-world objects and concepts. If your database tables
            are well-designed, the development of the corresponding data classes will be greatly
            simplified.

        <h2 class="alert">Chen-model ERD</h2>
        <p>
            Good database design begins with identifying the Entities and their attributes.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chen Notation is a graphical notation used to represent entities, relationships,
            and attributes in an Entity-Relationship Diagram (ERD). ERD is a data modeling
            technique used to describe the relationships between entities in a database.
        </p>
        <p>
            The Chen notation was developed by Peter Chen in the 1970s and is also known as
            the "Chen ERD" or "Chen model." It is one of the most widely used ERD notations.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Chen notation, an entity is represented by a rectangle with its name written
            inside it. Relationships between entities are represented by lines connecting
            them, with a diamond shape on the connecting line representing the relationship.
            The name of the relationship is written inside the diamond.
        </p>
        <p>
            Attributes are represented as ovals or ellipses connected to the entity rectangle
            by a line. The name of the attribute is written inside the oval. Primary keys are
            underlined within the attribute ovals.
        </p>
        <p>
            Chen notation provides a clear and concise way to represent complex data models,
            making it a useful tool for database design and development.
        </p>
        <p>
            The simplicity and clarity of the Chen ERD makes it very useful for early
            data diagramming.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            There are many tutorials online about creating the ERD (specifically the Chen ERD,
            not the crows-foot ERD). The following video explains this in an easy to understand
            way. I don't particularly like that the speaker uses bent instead of straight
            lines, which is more conventional or this type of diagram, but he does a good
            job of explaining it.

        <p>
            The presenter in this second video actually does a better job of representing
            the ERD but he may not explain the concepts in quite the same detail as the first.
            I believe it is a good follow up, and worthwhile.

        <p>
            Before we leave the ERD behind, there is one more resource which I think is excellent
            to have available as a reference when creating your own ERDs.

    <div id="class-diagrams" style="padding:20px;">
        <h2 class="alert">Class Diagrams</h2>
        <p>
            The UML class diagram is a visual representation of the structure of a system
            or application using object-oriented concepts. It is one of the most widely
            used types of UML diagrams and is used to model the classes, objects, and their
            relationships in a system.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a UML class diagram, each class is represented as a rectangle with the class
            name in the top section, followed by the class attributes (properties) in the
            middle section, and the class methods (functions) in the bottom section. The
            class attributes and methods are separated by a horizontal line.
        </p>
        <p>
            Arrows are used to represent the relationships between classes. For example, a
            solid line with an arrowhead can represent an association between two classes,
            while a diamond-shaped arrowhead can represent a composition relationship.
            Inheritance can also be represented using a solid line with an arrowhead
            pointing from the subclass to the superclass.
        </p>
        <p>
            UML class diagrams are useful for both software developers and stakeholders,
            as they provide a high-level view of the system's structure, which can be used
            for communication, documentation, and design. They are also used as a basis
            for generating code, as they can provide a detailed view of the classes, methods,
            and relationships needed to implement a system.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            Like before with the ERD, there are many videos available which discuss and
            describe UML class diagrams. I chose this one because I think he does a good
            job of explaining the concepts and the process clearly. Also, although some of 
            his discussion is specific to the tool he is demonstrating, applying the same
            process to another drawing tool won't be difficult.
