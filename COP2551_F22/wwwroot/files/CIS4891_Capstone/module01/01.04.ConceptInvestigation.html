        <h3>Description</h3>
        <p>
            This week we will launch our semester-long development project. The project 
            will evolve over the duration of the course. Each week's assignment is 
            designed to highlight a particular phase of the Software Development Life 
            Cycle <strong>(SDLC).</strong>
        </p>

        </p>
        <p>
            Although most engineers agree that there will be some inherent recursion 
            and overlap between the phases of the SDLC, and that the process framework 
            will be tailored according to the scope of each project, the sequence and 
            objective of each phase shouldn't be overlooked.
        </p>
        <p>
            This week you'll be identifying and researching project ideas. In the next 
            couple of weeks, you'll narrow the scope and present your idea and preliminary 
            design to your peers, gather feedback, and further refine your project plan.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            Your project doesn't need to be brand new and unique, but your implementation 
            will.
        </p>
        <p>
            Begin to think about the kind of project to showcase. List the specific 
            functionalities of the chosen kind of project, and some preliminary 
            investigation toward implementing the project. All projects must include:
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li>a data component
            <ul>
                <li>The data will be stored in a database</li>
                <li>Data access will be via an intermediate API</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
            <li>and an interface component
            <ul>
                <li>There may be multiple applications accessing the API for external 
                    users and administration</li>
                <li>Applications may be web, native mobile apps, console apps, or 
                    platform-specific native applications.</li>
            </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <em>
            There is a lot of detail and room for interpretation here. Now is the time 
            to ask questions. Discord is a good place to discuss your questions.

                    This project was intended for developing cloud-hosted web applications.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is still my recommendation that you consider developing your project
                    for this platform, but many students will have compelling reasons for 
                    developing for another purpose.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Your project will include a database, accessed through an API, and a
                    front-end GUI. This is well-suited for a web app, hosted locally or
                    on another server or servers. We will be discussing your approach over
                    the next couple of weeks, so now is a good time to consider options.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                For this project, start by browsing the internet and considering websites that 
                you commonly visit. What is it about the site that makes it useful? Are there 
                other sites that enable similar functionality? What makes it appealing? What 
                problem does it solve?
            </p>
            <ul>
                The project is designed to:
                <li>give a realistic look at the larger life cycle of taking ideas and turning 
                    them into useful software-based systems</li>
                <li>provide insight into the organizational and inter-personal aspects of project 
                    management</li>
                <li>give experience with change management, builds and controls, and other 
                    management disciplines necessary to keep projects heading towards success 
                    (and keep costs within budget!)</li>
                <li>give design, build, test and support experience with software systems</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                This is an individual project. Each student is building a portfolio that reflects their 
                growth and development as a software and systems professional.</p>
            <p>
                It is also a collaborative project. There will be opportunity to discuss and work 
                with classmates informally and formally as parts of task-focused teams.</p>
            <p>
                If two or more students have closely aligned projects, a shared database solution
                may also be acceptable. If you want to take this approach, please discuss with me.
                Database schema can be developed and managed jointly, and data populated individually
                but the front-end applications should still be unique.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of these deliverables will be formal documents, or code files, or reports; 
                others will be accomplished with formal or informal presentations, discussions, 
                whiteboarding, or other options.</p>
            <p>
                Projects will be hosted on public Github repositories. The project owner will 
                maintain all control of the code and artifacts, but these will have public 
                read-only visibility.
            </p>
            <p>The instructor will guide the project and the process, step by step.</p>
