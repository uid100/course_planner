                Since we don't have the opportunity to go around the classroom and have 
                people introduce themselves, we're going to do an online introduction 
                and share a little bit about ourselves.

                This advanced level course, occurs late in your undergraduate 
                path. At this stage, most students will be working on closing this current
                chapter and likely starting others. The paths leading to the prerequisite
                courses for this one has some variability built into it. Everyone's
                journey has been unique and I am interested in yours.

                As part of your introduction, tell us about the courses you have studied, 
                at this school, at others, or in any other professional or other area. How 
                would you summarize and describe what you are learning or have learned? 
                What did you find interesting? What do you wish you had spent more time learning?
            </li>
            <li>
                If you could advise other students starting down the same path, 
                what would you recommend, and what do you wish you had done differently?
            </li>

                requirement. <em>Remember to join our Discord channel to say hello.</em>

                matter.
