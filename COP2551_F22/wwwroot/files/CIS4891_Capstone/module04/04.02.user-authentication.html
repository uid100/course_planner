        <p>
            I was looking through the project specification documents that you submitted and I'm 
            encouraged by the thought and creativity you are all showing in your design process. 
            Most, if not all of the development projects I saw rely on some level of authorized 
            user access or user account identity.
        </p>
        <p>
            In past semesters, using this similar project outline, user authentication and 
            authorization was a topic that was discussed later in the term. I know now that was
            unfortunate, so I wanted to launch this topic now for you to consider.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is not surprising that <em>user logins</em> are mentioned in most of your proposals. 
            Just about everything that we do using network applications needs some level of 
            information about the user to be effective and provide value. If you ask for tide 
            tables, I need to know your location, or at least your location of interest.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you want to purchase something online, I need to know where it is being
            shipped, or if shipping to you is even allowed. Many states have laws prohibiting 
            the shipment of certain goods. My daughter was living on the island of Kaua'i for three
            years and often it was less expensive for her to fly to Oahu, or even to the mainland
            to purchase household goods than the cost for shipping to the outer islands.
        </p>

            Of course any app that includes messaging needs to ensure that messages are delivered
            to the intended recipient.

        <h2 class="alert">How do I know it's you?</h2>
        <p>
            Authentication, if not <em>most</em> important, becomes very important. This is not
            a new concept for application development, but you might be surprised at how the
            solutions and performance expectations have changed over the years.
        </p>
        <p>
            The question eventually becomes how to implement user authentication in your application.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once upon a time, it was enough to prompt the user and ask for their username.
            (<em>Ok. Hi Bob. Welcome Back.</em>) If the user had physical access to the system,
            it must be ok, and all I really care about is what their name is, so I know how
            to greet them and where to find <em>their</em> files.
        </p>
        <p>
            That was adequate until it wasn't. Next the application would ask for a password
            and the application would store the password. In time, this became bad practice
            too.
        </p>
        <p>
            How many passwords do we need to manage now? If we are using strong encryption to
            manage and encrypt store and recover passwords, there are many points of failure
            and overhead and risk.
        </p>
        <p>
            In most cases, I don't need to know anything about you except to recognize you 
            when you return. I likely don't need to know anything about the user, except 
            that they were here before and that someone else isn't pretending to be them.
        </p>
        <p>
            Software libraries were written to help with this, and we could build databases and 
            support methods, but the result is reinventing a wheel which is probably already 
            obsolete.
        </p>
        <p>
            Federated passwords and IDaaS is a much better solution. Perhaps not 5 years
            ago, but by now, most of us are familiar with Single Sign-On (SSO) and mult-factor
            authentication (MFA).
        </p>
        <p>
            When you visit sites that invite you to login using Facebook or Google or
            Microsoft, they very likely do not care about your Facebook or Google or
            Microsoft accounts, they are simply using them as a trusted authority to validate
            the claim that you are who you say your are. As developers, we probably don't care
            about where a user had dinner or which memes they LOL-d. All we care about is
            that a trusted authority said, "yeah, he is who he claims to be. (Because I
            said so.)"

        <p>
            This series, although a couple years old now, provides an excellent introduction
            to implementing Identity in your code. The later sessions deal with some specifics
            about using MS-Identity in a .NET application, but the fundamentals are worth
            your time.
        </p>
        <p>
            These episodes are a little long (~60min). I suggest that you watching the first one
            at 1.5x speed, and then slow them down when you find something of interest. Maybe
            slow down to 1.25x for Epsisode 2, and then take a break and come back and watch
            Episode 3.
        </p>
        <div class="ic-flash-info">
            <strong>Spoiler alert:</strong> the takeaway from this series, is not to help you
            learn how to implement user authentication, but to convince you not to write a
            home-grown solution. (see Episode 3)

            Episode 1 (of 9) is interesting, and not especially technical. You can almost run this
            in the background when you are working on something else. There is a good discussion
            and explanation of what we mean by concepts such as claims and trusted authority.
            Between the casual back and forth, this discussion does a good job of explaining
            what the problem is and why it needs a solution.

            In the next edition (episode 2), the hosts go further into the technical approach
            to the problem, still at a high level and explaining the differences between impersonation
            and selected delegation with (Open Authorization - OAuth2.0) and finally a discription
            of OpenID Connect. More than just a walk-through of how to integrate these standards,
            this discussion presents a good explanation of the what, why, and how. Even just as a
            casual user of modern web applications, this is a helpful discussion of the state
            of the industry how to do authentication in modern applications.

            Episode 3. Yes, there are 9 episodes if you're interested. But episode 3 is worth your
            time.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my experience, I have implemented applications with what we believed to be secure,
            robust sign-on sytems, and at the time, they were reasonable solutions. In hind-sight
            there were unrecognized, or under-appreciated risks everywhere.
        </p>
        <p>
            Robust security is a concern, and identifying and avoiding vulnerabilities is certainly
            a concern, but while the details of the implementation are beyond the scope of what we
            can cover in this course, if you are going to build modern software applications, it is
            worth your time to watch and understand modern authentication best practices. If you
            decide to defer the rest of this series until another time, that is ok, but watch
            at least through episode 3 so that if you will be better informed about, not just how
            to build more secure apps, but why and just what the risks are.

            Unfortunately, a comprehensive catalog of this series and links is not readily available,
            but I've assembled this. I hope that someone finds it helpful. At some point, I'd like to
            add keywords and brief notes to these to make it a more useful reference.

            Some of you may decided to view all of these, but if you get through the first 3, and
            hear the message, that will be enough for now.
