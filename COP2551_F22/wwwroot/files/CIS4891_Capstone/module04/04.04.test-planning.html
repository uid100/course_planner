            <p>
                Software testing begins at the beginning of a project life cycle and
                continues throughout. At the start, the test team is concerned with
                understanding the requirements, and planning for objective ways to
                test each with the objective of determining whether each has been
                satisfied.
            </p>
            <ol>
                There are several types of software testing, including:
                <li>
                    Unit Testing: testing individual components or units of the
                    software.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Integration Testing: testing interactions between multiple
                    units or components.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Functional Testing: testing the software against the specified
                    requirements to confirm it functions as intended.
                </li>
                <li>
                    System Testing: testing the entire system as a whole, including
                    all components and interactions.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Acceptance Testing: testing the software to determine whether
                    it is acceptable for release to the end-users.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Regression Testing: testing the software to ensure that changes
                    and new features do not negatively impact existing
                    functionality.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Performance Testing: testing the software to evaluate its speed,
                    stability, and scalability.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Security Testing: testing the software to identify and address
                    security risks and vulnerabilities.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Usability Testing: testing the software to evaluate its
                    user-friendliness and ease of use.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Exploratory Testing: ad-hoc testing with the goal of discovering
                    defects and improving the overall understanding of the software.
                </li>

            <h3 class="alert">Activities</h3>
            <p>
                Although testing activities take place throughout the project life
                cycle, acceptance testing is what is often associated with the
                so-called <em>testing</em> phase of the SDLC.
            </p>
            <p>
                Requirements development is subjected to reviews to reduce or eliminate
                conflicts within them and to ensure they are logical, realistic, and
                objectively testable.
            </p>
            <p>
                During solution design, the design is reviewed to ensure the requirements
                are all being addressed and each requirement may be assigned to a particular
                component or subsystem of the solution.
            </p>
            <p>
                Throughout implementation, the developers will consider the solution
                design and the relevant requirements and implement unit-testing so
                that each smallest unit, method, module, interface... will satsify
                the requirements assigned to it.
            </p>
            <p>
                As the system is integrated, the team will continue to perform unit-testing
                and test that the system components work together, and individually still
                operate as designed.
            </p>
            <p>
                When the solution is built, and all unit testing is passing, and the
                integration team is satisfied that the system is ready for
                <em>acceptance testing,</em> the system is tested first to see that
                each one of the identified and approved requirements is met and passing
                (validation), then the system should be moved to its intended
                environment and exercised to see that it satisfies the original intended
                use.

        <div id="test-phases">
            <h3 class="alert">Test Phases</h3>
            <ul>
                The software testing process typically involves the following phases:
                <li>
                    Planning and Preparation: Define the test objectives, detail strategy
                    and test plan, and preparing the testing environment.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Test Analysis and Design: This phase involves defining and documenting
                    the test cases and test data, as well as creating test artifacts such
                    as test scripts, test scenarios, and test data.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Test Implementation and Execution: This phase involves executing the
                    test cases and test scenarios and documenting the results. This phase
                    may also involve debugging the software and fixing defects.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Result Analysis: This phase involves evaluating the test results,
                    identifying any failures or defects, and determining the cause of the
                    failures.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Test Closure: This phase involves documenting the test results, preparing
                    a final report, and archiving the test artifacts. The test closure phase
                    may also involve assessing the effectiveness of the testing process and
                    making recommendations for improvement.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                It's worth noting that these phases are iterative and may be repeated
                multiple times as part of an Agile development process. The goal of
                the testing process is to identify defects and improve the quality of
                the software before it is released to end-users.

        <div id="val-ver" style="padding:20px;">
            <h3 class="alert">Verification and Validation (V&V)</h3>
            <p>
                <strong>Verification</strong> and <strong>validation</strong> are two
                important concepts in software development and testing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Verification refers to the process of checking whether the software
                development process conforms to the standards, regulations, and
                guidelines. This includes activities such as code reviews, walkthroughs,
                and inspections, and its goal is to ensure that the software is being
                developed correctly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Validation, on the other hand, refers to the process of evaluating
                software at the end of the development process to determine whether
                it meets the specified requirements. The goal of validation is to
                ensure that the software works as intended and satisfies the needs
                of the end-users. This includes activities such as functional testing,
                acceptance testing, and user acceptance testing.

    <div id="methods">
        <h3 class="alert">Methods</h3>
        <p>
            Some common methods for measurement of success include:
            <ul>
                <li>inspection</li>
                <li>demonstration</li>
                <li>analysis</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Inspection</strong> is a systematic review of requirements documents.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Demonstration</strong> is a step-by-step review with stakeholders
            and subject matter experts to confirm the requirements are met.
        </p>
        <p>
            Analysis uses mathematical models or simulations to verify the requirements
            and provide a comprehensive assessment. For instance if a method outputs
            a calculated result for given inputs, the test engineers might use another
            method to calculate the result for comparison.
        </p>

        <p class="ic-flash-info">
            For each of your <em>testable</em> requirements, which of these methods would
            best be used for verification?
