        <p>
            Working on your project, you are the customer, the project manager,
            the requirements engineer, the test lead, the developer(s),
            the quality assurance group, the caterer and probably a few
            other roles. For a small project, having too many requirements
            probably is not going to be productive.
        </p>
        <p>
            Instead, take another look through your User Stories and Use-Cases,
            define a list of <em>at least 5</em> requirements and put them in a table in
            your GitHub README document.
        </p>
        <p class="ic-flash-info">
            Add a table of requirements to your README
        </p>
        <p>
            Requirements are sometimes called <em>the Shall statements.</em>
            Remember that your requirements should specifically reference what
            the <em>software</em> or <em>system</em> <strong>shall</strong> do,
            <em>not</em> the user. Software requirements cannot impose requirements
            on what the "user shall" do.
        </p>
        <p>
            For now, your table should have two columns, an id number,
            this can be a simple integer, or you may use a hierarchical
            numbering if you want to do some investigation into User
            Level, System Level, Component Level, and Software Level
            requirements. This can get complex quickly, so it is
            optional.
        </p>
        <p>
            We'll add columns to this table later.
        </p>
        <p>
            For each of your requirements ask:
        </p>
        <p class="ic-flash-info">Can this be objectively tested?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            Remember that a well written software requirement is clear, concise, and specific, 
            and can be understood by both technical and non-technical stakeholders. It should 
            define what the software should do, not how it should do it. Here is an example:
        </p>
        <p class="ic-flash-info">
            "The software shall allow users to search for and view information about available 
            products in a product catalog. The search functionality shall allow users to filter 
            results by category, price, and brand. The view functionality shall display the 
            product name, image, description, price, and brand."
        </p>

            Hint: search for <em>GitHub Markdown Cheatsheet</em> for
            help formatting tables in your README.md
        </p>
        <p>
            Add a header to your README above your requirements table
            to make it easier to find.
        </p>
        <p>
            When you have updated the README, submit (text box) a link
            to the project repository in Canvas.
        </p>
