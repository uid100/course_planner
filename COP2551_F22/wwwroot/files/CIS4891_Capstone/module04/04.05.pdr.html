        <p>
            In the last module, you prepared a set of design artifacts.
            <ul>
                <li>Description and README</li>
                <li>Solution architecture diagram</li>
                <li>Wireframe diagram(s)</li>
                <li>User Stories</li>
                <li>Initial Use Cases</li>
                <li>Use Case Diagram</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p style="font-style:italic;">
            The design documents in your readme will tell a visitor a story and communicate
            your vision for your project application.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your project repository is a work-in-progress. This
            week, you'll be adding to it. It's a good idea and usually
            a project requirement, to share project progress and status
            with others to get feedback and comments. 
        </p>
        <p>
            In a formal project, there are a series of phased reviews
            after a development contract is in place. Commonly, the
            requirements will go through a round of reviews, culminating
            with a <em>final</em> requirements review, which is formally
            agreed to and signed off by the customer, before the design
            phase officially kicks off.
        </p>
        <p>
            At some point, the design team presents their preliminary
            design documents to the customer and other stakeholders to
            get approval that the design is consistent with the requirements
            and is achievable and that it all are in agreement. Like
            other reviews, this review activity may repeat some number 
            of times until the stakeholders agree on the project direction.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes the customer doesn't know what they want until they
            see what they don't want.

        <h3>Initial Post (25 points)</h3>
        <p style="background-color:yellow;">
            Complete this initial post not later than Wednesday night,
            so that others have time for their review.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this discussion activity, your initial post should
            contain a link to your repository (and the README), and 
            a brief paragraph describing the project and the current
            status of the design documents.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you haven't already done so, consider adding a table of 
            contents at or near the top of your README, using each of 
            your section headers, to make it more organized and make
            all of your design documents easy to find.
        <p>
            The README should both describe the project and show the
            evolution and the status of the project.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Next (25 points each)</h3>
        <p>
            Review 3 other students' projects and
            provide thoughtful, meaningful feedback, questions, and
            suggestions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sharing of information is a good thing. Some students
            may be inspired by some of the work others are doing and
            might employ some of the ideas from them. This collaborative
            work benefits all of us. As a group, it should be a goal
            to make all of these projects as professional as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            All projects benefit from diverse perspectives. As always,
            keep your comments respectful.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note: This is a review of a document and project in progress.
            Even this week, more is being added to the repository. The
            review should focus on the completed design artifacts first.
