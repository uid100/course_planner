        <p>
            In the last module, we talked about generating User-Stories
            from thoughtful conversations with the intended user or
            customer, ideally in the context of the target operating
            environment. From these User Stories, a solution can be
            proposed and system Use-Cases developed.
        </p>
        <p>
            This usually leads to generation of formal requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            Large, formal projects can typically generate hundreds
            of requirements. These formal requirements ensure that projects
            meet as well as stay within scope the scope of contracted work.
            In simple terms, to make sure the customer gets what they're
            paying for, and so that the development team gets paid for
            what they deliver.
        </p>
        <p>
            So for most projects, requirements are a very important part of
            the development process.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is not unusual for large contracted projects to have teams
            of engineers working on requirements management. These engineers
            try to ensure that the customer's objectives and the designed
            solution match and that the understood objectives are clearly
            communicated between the customer and the development team.
            This requires considerable back and forth communications to
            ensure that the customer knows what they are ordering and that
            the development team stays within those bounds.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are formal document templates for writing standard
            requirements specification documents, but we are only going
            to focus on a very small piece of that, writing and recognizing
            <em>good</em> requirements.

        <ul>
            A good requirement definition should be:
            <li>Clear: It should be well-defined, easy to understand and free of ambiguity.</li>
            <li>Complete: It should include all necessary information, including constraints and assumptions, to fully describe the requirement.</li>
            <li>Consistent: It should not contradict other requirements and should align with the overall project goals and objectives.</li>
            <li>Traceable: It should be traceable to the source of the requirement, such as customer needs, business goals, and regulatory requirements.</li>
            <li>Verifiable: It should be testable, measurable and have clear acceptance criteria.</li>
            <li>Relevant: It should be directly related to the project and necessary for its successful completion.</li>
            <li>Prioritized: Requirements should be prioritized based on their importance, feasibility, and dependencies.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            By having these characteristics, a requirement definition can
            help ensure that the final product meets the needs and
            expectations of stakeholders and supports the success of
            the project.
