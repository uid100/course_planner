        <h2 class="alert">Defining Requirements</h2>

        <p>
            In the last module, we talked about generating User-Stories
            from thoughtful conversations with the intended user or
            customer, ideally in the context of the target operating
            environment. From these User Stories, a solution can be
            proposed and system Use-Cases developed.
        </p>
        <p>
            This usually leads to generation of formal requirements.
        </p>
        <p>
            Large, formal projects can typically generate hundreds
            of requirements. These formal requirements ensure that projects
            meet as well as stay within scope the scope of contracted work.
            In simple terms, to make sure the customer gets what they're
            paying for, and so that the development team gets paid for
            what they deliver.
        </p>
        <p>
            So for most projects, requirements are a very important part of
            the development process.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is not unusual for large contracted projects to have teams
            of engineers working on requirements management. These engineers
            try to ensure that the customer's objectives and the designed
            solution match and that the understood objectives are clearly
            communicated between the customer and the development team.
            This requires considerable back and forth communications to
            ensure that the customer knows what they are ordering and that
            the development team stays within those bounds.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are formal document templates for writing standard
            requirements specification documents, but we are only going
            to focus on a very small piece of that, writing and recognizing
            <em>good</em> requirements.

        <h2 class="alert">Writing Good Requirements</h2>
        <ul>
            A good requirement definition should be:
            <li>Clear: It should be well-defined, easy to understand and free of ambiguity.</li>
            <li>Complete: It should include all necessary information, including constraints and assumptions, to fully describe the requirement.</li>
            <li>Consistent: It should not contradict other requirements and should align with the overall project goals and objectives.</li>
            <li>Traceable: It should be traceable to the source of the requirement, such as customer needs, business goals, and regulatory requirements.</li>
            <li>Verifiable: It should be testable, measurable and have clear acceptance criteria.</li>
            <li>Relevant: It should be directly related to the project and necessary for its successful completion.</li>
            <li>Prioritized: Requirements should be prioritized based on their importance, feasibility, and dependencies.</li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            By having these characteristics, a requirement definition can
            help ensure that the final product meets the needs and
            expectations of stakeholders and supports the success of
            the project.

    <div id="reqt-decomp" style="padding:20px;">
        <h2 class="alert">Decomposing Requirements</h2>
        <p>
            Requirements decomposition is the process of breaking down high-level requirements 
            into smaller, more specific and manageable parts. It helps to clarify, organize and 
            prioritize requirements, and to ensure that each requirement can be traced back to 
            its origin.
        </p>
        <p>
            <ul>
            Decomposition can occur at different levels:
                <li>
                    From user requirements to system requirements: The process of identifying 
                    and documenting the high-level functional and non-functional requirements 
                    that the system must meet to satisfy its users.
                </li>
                <li>
                    From system requirements to software requirements: The process of defining 
                    the software functions and characteristics that are necessary to implement 
                    the system requirements.
                </li>
                <li>
                    From software requirements to component requirements: The process of 
                    specifying the detailed requirements for individual software components 
                    that make up the overall software system.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
           The goal of requirements decomposition is to ensure that each requirement is specific, 
            testable, and traceable, and that all requirements are covered and accounted for in 
            the final product.
        </p>
        <p>
            The lower level requirements (system, software, component) always should directly 
            support the top level requirements (usually called the user requirements)
        </p>
        <p>
            The idea is that if the all of the lower level requirements are met, then the top-level
            requirements are thought to be met also.
        </p>

        <p>
            Here's an example of a decomposed requirement from a top-level requirement:
        </p>
        <dl>
            <dt>Top-level requirement:</dt>
            <dd>2.0 "The software must allow users to manage their personal finances."</dd>

            <dt>Decomposed requirements:</dt>
            <dd>2.1 "The software must allow users to input and categorize their income and expenses."</dd>
            <dd>2.2 "The software must provide a summary of users' spending by category."</dd>
            <dd>2.3 "The software must allow users to set budgets for each spending category and track their progress towards their budget goals."</dd>
            <dd>2.4 "The software must provide users with a visual representation of their income and expenses over time."</dd>
            <dd>2.5 "The software must allow users to generate reports for tax purposes."</dd>
        </dl>

        <p>
            These decomposed requirements provide more detail and specificity to the top-level 
            requirement, making it easier to understand and implement. Each decomposed requirement 
            can be further decomposed into smaller, more manageable parts if necessary.
        </p>

    <div id="req-mgmt" style="padding:20px;">
        <h2 class="alert">Managing Requirements</h2>
        <p>
            Requirements management encompasses several activities, from capturing originating
            requirements from investigation with stakeholders (customers, end-users, subject-matter
            experts and project teams), analysis, documentation, prioritization, and requirements
            tracing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Requirements tracing includes ensuring that decomposed requirements accurately and
            completely support higher level requirements and that all requirements are correctly
            verified and validated.
        </p>
        <p>
            To further complicate the issue, requirements change.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many things that can drive requirements change. Sometimes regulation
            compliance issues arise which could not have been anticipated, or a dependency
            on am external interface which is no longer supported, or the customer's need
            or perception changes.
        </p>
        <p>
            An important part of requirements management is minimizing requirements
            volatility and analyzing the impacts with they do change.
