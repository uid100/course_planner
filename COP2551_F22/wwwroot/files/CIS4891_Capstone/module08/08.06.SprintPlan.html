            included a link to an introduction to Scrum fundamentals. If you
            missed some of that, or want to review it, this is a good time to revisit that
            instruction. It will help with this and the next assignment.

        <h3>SDLC .. background (again)</h3>
        <p>
            In general terms, every formal process is a prescribed sequence of activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            The software engineering discipline has continually evolved and developed formal
            processes for the development of systems and software in an attempt to improve
            efficiency and product quality.
        </p>
        <p>
            A simplified view of the so-called <em>waterfall</em> system development life
            cycle (SDLC) is comprised of
        </p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>requirements</strong> gathering and decomposition</li>
            <li>solution <strong>design</strong></li>
            <li><strong>implementation and test</strong></li>
            <li>and <strong>maintenance and support</strong></li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            With some tailoring and variation, these cascading phases are delimited by stakeholder
            reviews and milestone gates.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although incremental and spiral development introduce other considerations with possibly
            different review cycles and activities, each of the phases listed above are still
            followed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Some of the challenges with these traditional workflows include long lag time between
            stakeholder feedback through interim progress reviews, artifically imposed serialization
            of activities, and complexities involving change management.

        <h3>Agile Software Development</h3>
        <p>
            As you've seen, among the better known methodologies which have grown out of the
            efforts toward a more agile approach, are the principles are <em>Scrum</em> and
            <em>Kanban</em>.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Scrum</h3>
        <p>
            The Scrum methodology intends to deliver progressively more mature versions of a
            product solution in short time intervals called <em>sprints</em> with more frequent
            feedback interaction with stakeholders. The practice calls for daily team interaction,
            and a formal cycle of planning and delivery meetings. Although the process is often
            tailored, and is likely to vary considerably between teams, the scrum team concerns
            themselves only with the issues formally assigned and committed for the brief
            <em>sprint</em> period and collaborates internally. The practice is sometimes criticized
            for lacking longer cycle visibility, planning, and tracking but it is the Product
            Owner's responsibility to balance the prioritized backlog list against program
            objectives, in order to effectively achieve a final product delivery which meets
            top-level requirements and avoid a perpetual cycle of change without progress toward
            completion.
        </p>
        <h3>Kanban</h3>
        <p>
            Another practice which has been associated with the efforts toward more agile software
            development, is called <em>Kanban</em> from the Japanese meaning sign or billboard.
            This practice is best know from process documentation associated with Toyota automotive
            company's manufacturing practices. The practice involves posting physical task cards
            which are visually advanced from states of "not started", "in-progress", and "complete."
            Primary goals of this are visibility into progess, process bottlenecks and issues, and
            reducing or eliminating waiting times by using a just-in-time <em>pull</em> rather
            than <em>push</em> strategy.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although these practices sometimes use slightly different terminology and activities,
            they are not mutually exclusive.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            Your student project began with concept investigation and requirements development,
            data analysis considerations and data model development, database implementation and
            code integration, and system workflow analysis, and user interface design. The few
            remaining weeks will proceed with accelerated development, candidate product deliveries,
            and recursive testing and code development.
        </p>
        <p>
            Accordingly, <strong>plan the remaining work</strong> and the upcoming sprint starting
            with creating the formal prioritized product backlog items (PBIs) in your project
            repository.

                <ol>
                    A well constructed issue should contain:
                    <li>
                        A user story. This is not always going to be the system user. This is meant to

                    <li>
                        Acceptance criteria. Clarify the objectives of the issue. Know when it's done.

                        error messages, etc.. to assist the developer with reproducing the error, or
                        linking to pre-existing designs.

                You should have at least 15 (probably more) items on your backlog list. Your backlog list
                can (and usually should) contain things that may never be implemented. Consider and include
                future enhancements.

                Create a project board from your repository (can be Sprint 1, Sprint 2, ...) and add
                prioritized issues from your backlog. Decide how many you will complete during the Sprint
                (assume one week for this exercise).
            </p>
            <p>
                Move the issues across the columns
                <ul>
                    from:
                    <li>To Do (Planned)</li>
                </ul>
                <ul>

            </p>
            <p>
                You will likely not want to have more than 2, maybe 3 active issues "In Progress" at a
