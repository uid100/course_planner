        <p>
            Recall that the scrum methodology is built around project execution timeboxes
            measured in iterations called <em>sprints</em> each of those has a planning
            event, daily <em>standup</em> or <em>scrum</em> meetings, sprint reviews,
            and sprint retrospectives.
        </p>
        <p>
            The sprint review involves the sprint team presenting progress against the
            proposed goals to the stakeholders.
        </p>
        <h3>objective</h3>
        <p>
            Complete the Sprint cycle with regular progress tracking and reporting.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <p>
            Correctly planning and executing to a sprint plan is essential to tracking 
            progress within scrum methodology.

            Product Backlog Items (PBIs) may be sourced from internal as well as external 
            stakeholders but backlog grooming is the product owner's responsibility. The 
            scrum team commits to how many of the highest priority items that they can 
            accomplish during the sprint and, as a team, completes those items one-by-one. 
            At the end of the sprint, the scrum team presents their results to the 
            stakeholders for feedback, project support, and potential requirements change.
        </p>
        <p>
            This week, execute to your project list, each day moving items from your todo 
            list, to Work-in-progress (WIP) and finally to 'complete'.
        </p>
        <h3 class="alert">Submission</h3>
        <ol>
            Submit:
            <li>
                <strong>Daily screenshots</strong>, Each day take a screenshot of the 
                (Kanban) issue board. At the end of the sprint, submit your daily 
                screenshots.
            </li>

                <strong>Burndown chart</strong> (<a  style="color:navy;" 
                   href="https://www.atlassian.com/agile/tutorials/burndown-charts#:~:text=What%20is%20a%20burndown%20chart,work%20in%20the%20time%20available.">
                    <em>what is a burndown chart?</em></a>) 
                There are many sprint tracking tools available. Github is convenient 
                because you can track all elements of your project together, but it 
                doesn't support burndown charts yet. Use any tool to show what a burndown 
                chart of your sprint might look like.<br />
                Perfect execution would show the planned items beginning on the upper left
                and the plan and actual completion coming together at the lower right at
                the end of the sprint. Actual execution is (almost) never perfect. I
                do not expect to see the actual meeting up with the plan.

                <strong>Sprint Review</strong> Answer the following:
                <ul>
                    <li>Did you complete all items in your sprint plan?</li>
                    <li>What is your sprint deliverable? (shippable product(s))</li>
                    <li>Did you have any task volatility, and what was the cause?</li>
                    <li>What would you do differently knowing what you know now?</li>
                </ul>
                Note: This is a lessons learned page. It takes most teams several
                iterations of sprint planning and reviews before they start to get
                it <em>right</em>. Report what happened, not what <em>should have</em>
                happened.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>(Next) Sprint Plan</strong> Create another 'project' 
                (may be named "sprint 2") and add items from your prioritized backlog 
                issues. Attach a screenshot of the new (Kanban) Sprint issues board 
                (sprint plan)
            </li>
