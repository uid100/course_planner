        <h3 class="alert">Sprint Planning</h3>
        <p>
            One of the skills that a team will learn over time is how to accurately forecast
            the work which can be accomplished by the team in the period defined by a single
            time period, or sprint. Most teams have selected 2 week terms as sprints and have
            observed that 1 week is not enough time to complete a significant amount of work
            and that 3 weeks is a little too long for accurate forecasts. Still, each team
            will find what works for them.
        </p>
        <h4>Sprint Points</h4>
        <p>
            Often the Sprint planning meeting will start with the team assembled with the 
            prioritized backlog list. The items near the top of the list will be <em>voted</em>
            with fibonacci cards (1,2,3,5,8,13,21) to approximate the level of complexity.
            The points voted are assessed and averaged. The (secret) votes are expected to all
            align very closely. If someone votes much higher or lower than the average, then
            a discussion takes place to ensure common understanding of complexity of the backlog
            item and the work required. It may be that the highest bid knows more about the 
            task, or that the high and low can be discarded and the average point value assigned.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once the top tasks from the prioritized list have points assigned, the team will 
            commit to completing the set of tasks that are equivalent to the number of points
            they have historically successfully completed. It usually takes several iterations
            for this number to be established. Once the list has been committed, they should 
            resist changing the commitment. If items are added to the list, an equivalent number
            of points are usually removed. It's not uncommon for the sprint plan to include items
            1, 2, 3, 5, 8, and 10 from the prioritized backlog item (PBI) list. Although items
            4, 6, 7, and 9 may be higher priority, the sprint points may be too many for a team
            to complete in a given sprint, so there may be a negotiation with the product owner
            and sprint team.
        </p>
        <p>
            To summarize, Sprint planning is hard. But like any other skill, it gets easier 
            with experience.
