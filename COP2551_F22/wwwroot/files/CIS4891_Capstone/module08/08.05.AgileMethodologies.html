        <p>
            In a previous module, we started a discussion of development methodologies
            and the emerging emphasis on being <em>agile</em> and what that means and
            why it's important. Change is unavoidable, responding to change is difficult.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            In 2000, seventeen industry leaders gathered to discuss and document what
            they deemed to be important industry values and principles. Read their 
            <em>manifesto</em> again.

            <em>Read between the lines</em> and consider the ideas discussed.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Process and tools</strong> are essential for creating repeatable, 
            cost-effective products. Without business support, most software and system 
            development would never happen. Finding ways to be more effecient are 
            essential to that objective, until those processes interfere with doing 
            those things.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes, <strong>comprehensive documentation</strong> is itself the 
            customer's objective and the deliverable product. Accurate design 
            documentation and records will also go a long way to aiding engineer and 
            end-user training and product maintenance and support. But more often, 
            design artifacts should approximate the final product. Used as a 
            communications tool to guide but not steer development.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Contracts <em>versus</em> collaboration</strong>. I've experienced 
            both sides of this, and it can be a sensitive topic. In my opinion, the 
            only beneficial path through this is to ensure that business interests between 
            customer and supplier are well-represented through the development process. 
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Change is constant</strong>. As you have heard, at the beginning 
            of a project, you can't know all that you don't know. <strong>Response</strong> 
            to change, more than anything else, is the goal of <em>agile development</em>.

    <h3 class="alert">Agile is Dead(, Long live Agile)</h3>
        <p class="ic-flash-info">
            <em>Agile</em> is an adjective!
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            In this course, we stated that for a software project, you will start out
            by developing <strong>requirements</strong> and planning and we practiced 
            it (a little).
        </p>
        <p>
            We emphasized the importance of design documentation, and practiced that.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then we changed gears and said that an <em>agile</em> response to change
            is essential and suggested <em>a</em> methodology to follow.
        </p>
        <p>
            In a more <em>agile</em> process, we still need requirements, but we only
            need enough to design around them. We still need a design, but we only need
            enough to communicate and clarify the concept both to ourselves and among
            the team and the stakeholders.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            15 years after the <em>Agile Manifesto</em> was written and made such an
            impact across the industry, Dave Thomas, author of <strong>The Pragmatic
            Programmer</strong>, and contributor to the <em>manifesto</em>,
            shared the following thoughts to an audience of peers. He discusses 
            the <em>new</em> state of the industry, what we've gotten right and where
            we're getting off track and offers advice for going forward.
        </p>
        <p>
            Process and methodology are helpful, but results matter. I would not 
            recommend a 40 minute discussion to you if I didn't feel it was valuable.
            I've watched this more than once. I hope you find it helpful.

    <div id="methodologies" style="padding:20px;">
        <h3 class="alert">Methodologies</h3>
        <p>
            The departure from the traditional <em>waterfall</em> pattern of the 
            <strong>SDLC</strong> is not as extreme as it seems. We still need an emphasis
            on <strong>Requirements</strong> capture, decomposition, and management. 
            <strong>Design</strong> artifacts are still a primary means of communication
            and preliminary development. Implementation and test still are dependent on
            one another and all of these go hand-in-hand with maintenance and support
            activities. The lessons we are learning probably have more to do with the 
            blurring of the boundaries between these activities
        </p>
        <p>
            The message from the video, is not that these methodologies are <em>bad</em>.
            But rather that they need to be tailored to meet objectives. Large, formal, 
            multi-team integration programs should have much different process requirements
            than smaller, simpler, fast-track projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Methodologies, guidelines, principles of practice are a good starting point.
            When you learn to play a musical instrument, you may start with playing scales,
            and you practice them until you are proficient, but noone expects the musician
            to be limited to playing scales forever. It is a skill which is a means to an
            end. Software development methodologies should also be followed closely to learn
            their value, and once the <em>why and how</em> are understood, they should be
            tailored to fit the needs of the project and organization.

            <h3>Extreme Programming (XP)</h3>
            <p>
                One of the more non-traditional approaches, XP is intended to accelerate product
                delivery by minimizing design in favor of <em>figuring it out along the way.</em>
            </p>
            <p>
                Extreme Programming (XP) is a software development methodology that emphasizes 
                teamwork, collaboration, customer satisfaction, and high-quality software development. 
                XP is one of the Agile software development methodologies and is intended to improve 
                software quality and responsiveness to changing customer requirements.
            </p>
            <p>
                XP is based on four core values: communication, simplicity, feedback, and courage. 
                These values guide the XP team in their approach to software development. XP has 
                several practices that support these values, including:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Planning: XP emphasizes continuous planning and frequent delivery of 
                        working software.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Testing: XP advocates for continuous automated testing to ensure the 
                        quality of the software being developed.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Pair Programming: In XP, developers work in pairs, sharing a single 
                        computer to complete programming tasks.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Continuous Integration: XP emphasizes frequent integration of code 
                        changes into a shared code repository.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Refactoring: XP encourages continuous refactoring to improve the quality 
                        of the codebase.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Simple Design: XP promotes a simple and clean design approach that 
                        focuses on the essential features needed by the customer.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Collective Ownership: XP encourages collective ownership of the codebase, 
                        where all team members can make changes and have a stake in the success 
                        of the project.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>
                Overall, XP is designed to help development teams quickly deliver high-quality 
                software that meets customer needs through a collaborative and iterative approach 
                to development.
            </p>
            <p>
                In some ways, XP is one of the least repeatable, and least understood, and often
                least accepted methodologies.

            <h3>Kanban</h3>
            <p>
                Kanban is a Japanese term that loosely translated means <em>visual cards</em>. The
                practice is in fact, built around a bulletin board with task cards. Members of the
                team select cards and complete tasks. A product lead ensures that tasks are prioritized
                and getting accomplished to meet the project goals.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kanban is a software development methodology that is based on the principles of 
                Lean manufacturing, which is focused on reducing waste in the form of unnecessary
                action and cost. Kanban originated in the manufacturing industry, where it was 
                used to improve production efficiency by managing the flow of work.
            </p>
            <p>
                In software development, Kanban is a visual process management system that helps 
                teams manage and prioritize their work. It is based on the concept of a Kanban board, 
                which is a visual representation of the work that needs to be done, work in progress, 
                and work that has been completed. The Kanban board is typically divided into columns 
                that represent different stages of the development process.
            </p>
            <p>
                Kanban emphasizes continuous delivery and encourages teams to work in small, 
                manageable batches. Work items are pulled from a backlog and added to the Kanban 
                board as the team is ready to work on them. As work progresses, team members move 
                work items across the board, from one column to the next, until the work is 
                completed.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the key principles of Kanban is to limit work in progress (WIP) to avoid 
                overloading the team and to ensure that work is completed efficiently. The number 
                of work items that can be in progress at any given time is typically limited to a 
                small number to help the team stay focused and ensure that work is completed quickly.

        <div id="scrum">
            <h3>Scrum</h3>
            <p>
                While Scrum and Kanban do share similarities, scrum is built around timebox boundaries
                called <em>sprints</em>. The team agrees on what can be accomplished in these fixed
                schedule increments and work proceeds, as a team, to complete the set of tasks. Often
                the team will arrange the sprint goals in a similar way to the Kanban board but the
                day-to-day operational cadence and stakeholder involvement is usually slightly different.
