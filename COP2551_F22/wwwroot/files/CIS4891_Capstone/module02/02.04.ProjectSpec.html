    <h3>Deliverable</h3>

    <p>
        Six to eight paragraph discussion of your proposed project. It should begin with a 
        short introduction and conclude with a short conclusion. It should include discussions 
        of the purpose of the software, an overall description of the high-level functional 
        requirements of the software (that is, what the software will actually do), a survey of 
        the relevant literature available that will assist you in completing your project, a 
        short discussion of similar software, and a brief discussion of your project plan. 
        Your writeup is not limited to two pages, and can include other sections that you feel 
        will help the reader in understanding your proposal.
    </p>
    <p>
        Remember that every system application has input, processing, and output. Identify 
        what the process will be collecting (input) and what it will be producing (output).
    </p>
    <p>
        Spend some time thinking about this. Your project will include creating a database 
        and using an API.
        <ul>
            <li>What data will you store</li>
            <li>What is the source for the data (upload? web scrape? external API?)</li>
            <li>What are some ways the data could be used?</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        Your paper should have a title, author, and date. Use headings in your proposal. 
        These should should have appropriate section and subsection headings if appropriate.
