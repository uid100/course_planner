        <h3>All of <em>Us</em></h3>
        <em>Really? Again?</em> (Yes, of course.)
        <ul style="margin-left:10%;">

                In polite society, we meet and introduce ourselves. It's not a bad thing.<br />
                And I have a Discussion board set up just for that purpose. (<em>
                    Hey, you can
                    get easy points for it!
                </em>).<br />
                <em>This one is a little different, please read the instructions.</em>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>All of <em>This</em></h3>
        <em>How is this going to work?</em>
        <p>
            First, there are no scheduled meetings. Except of course optional office hours.
            But you won&#39;t be doing this alone. Office hours are a great place to check in,
            ask questions, or just visit. <strong>Discord</strong> is a good virtual meeting
            place, and a great place to ask and answer questions and share ideas. And it&#39;s
            always there!
        </p>
        <p>
            This course is designed to be very much a <em>hands-on</em> experience. You will
            be expected to search for solutions when you run into a challenge and try to apply
            them. There will be some reading and some videos to explain finer points of solutions
            development, and more importantly there will be opportunities to design and create.
        </p>
        <p>
            My career began in research. In that environment, I was primarily responsible for 
            finding creative solutions for real world data collection and analysis in challenging 
            environments. Sometimes it meant writing software for instrument control and data 
            processing on a small ship rolling in heavy seas. Sometimes I was building cabinets, 
            designing and creating electrical and plumbing solutions for a mobile shipboard lab 
            facility. Sometimes it was negotiating with shipping agents and import/export 
            documentation in foreign ports. Always, it involved a changing set of requirements, 
            analysis, design, and implementation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Moving into the private sector, I ran IT departments for large banking operations,
            again looking for creative solutions to apply emerging technologies.
        </p>
        <p>
            Then, for many more years, I worked as a systems engineer and later project and program
            manager for large government contractors.
        </p>
        <p>
            Project management and systems engineering have different perspectives and approaches
            but they have many shared objectives. In this course, we will explore the end-to-end
            activities that are part of software solution development.
        </p>
        <p>
            Although eah of the student projects will be individual efforts, collaboration
            will be an important part of the experience also.

        <p>
            Yes. There are probably a few. This is an evolving course and much of what you are
            seeing is very much a work in progress. If you have questions or find something that
            just doesn&#39;t make sense, it may well be that something is missing, incorrect,
            images not appearing, broken links, or something that could just be clearer. Please
            let me know. Peer review and constructive feedback is always appreciated.
