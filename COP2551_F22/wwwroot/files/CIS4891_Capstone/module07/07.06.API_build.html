        <h2 class="alert">Data I/O</h2>
        <p>
            The data structure and I/O is a fundamental architectural building block for any
            development solution. Using APIs for data access helps support the design principle
            of separation of concerns. If the data source is compartmentalized, it is
            easier to isolate components for reusability, maintainability and extensibility.
        </p>
        <h3>Objective</h3>
        <p>
            Build and demonstrate an API to deliver sample data from your class models.

            A challenge of designing this course is that there are multiple and distinct
            entry paths. Usually, with a project of this scope, defining the requirements
            for building and deploying the data access layer would be more straightforward.
            So the objectives will be specific, but your solution can take different forms.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Build your data model class</strong></p>
                <p>
                    Select your code architecture and create the data model class from the
                    class model diagram from the earlier module step.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Create a small collection of sample data</strong></p>
                <p>
                    This may be created as a mock-repository, a small set of database rows,
                    or simply hard-coded <em>test-data.</em>
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p><strong>Create an API to return your data set</strong></p>
                <p>
                    It should have at a minimum a single GET action to return your dataset.
                    You may also implement additional actions to return specific records
                    or POST actions as well.
                </p>

                <p>
                    Using either a browser, or <code>curl</code> from a terminal command
                    line, connect to your API and show a screenshot of the result.

            With varying programming backgrounds, there are several approaches you might take
            for this assignment. Common approaches could be to code your solution using Node.JS
            or ASP.NET/C#. Both of these are popular industry standard approaches.
        </p>
        <p>
            My preference would be to code this using C#, and I've included a step-by-step
            example for this in the next section, but you are not limited to this approach.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Node.js</strong> is also a popular approach to creating web APIs, and there 
            are several tutorials online avaiable to you.
        </p>

        <h3 class="alert">ASP.NET API example</h3>
        <p>
            A common API implementation approach is to build the API in C#/.NET using ASP.NET
            framework and hosting on Microsoft's Azure cloud platform.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is an optional approach, but since most of the code is supplied, it should
            help simplify the task.
        </p>
        <ol>
            Using Visual Studio:
            <li>
                Create a new project using the "ASP.NET Core Web API" C# template. I named mine
                <code>MyDemoAPI</code> using no authentication and all other default settings.
                The sample project will be created, ready to edit to add your own changes. I
                did make one change to the project. This is not necessary, but I created a folder
                in the project called "Models" (at the same level as "Controllers"), I moved the
                WeatherForecast.cs (model) file to that folder, and Visual Studio updated the
                folder namespaces in the code for me. The project works fine with or without
                this change.
            </li>
            <li>
                Next, build and run it. I still have not written any code. Visual Studio will
                build the code and run it in its own hosting environment. It will also launch
                Swagger in your local browser. Swagger will enable you to interact with the
                different <em>endpoints</em> for both <code>GET</code> and <code>POST</code>
                and other <strong>http</strong> supported actions. In this case, the only
                endpoint in our API is [GET] https://localhost:[port]/WeatherForecast.
            </li>
            <li>
                Open a new browser window (apart from the one running Swagger). for the URL,
                use https://localhost:[port]/WeatherForecast. You can get the port number from
                the window running Swagger, or also from the command-line output where the API
                is <em>running</em>. It will tell you which port the https service is listening.
                If you review the Controllers/WeatherForecastController, you'll find a Get()
                method which is generating 5 days of random values for the <code>WeatherForecast</code>
                data model. Back in the browser window (https://localhost:7093/weatherforecast,
                this is not case sensitive) you can review the JSON-formatted data output.
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    My default browser is Chrome, yours may be something else. Find and install
                    a JSON formatter browser extension, and refresh your data page. It should look
                    something like this:
                </p>
                <p>
                    <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"
                         src="/courses/456310/files/46759642/preview"
                         alt="weather forcast JSON response" />
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is still simulated data, but you can see that the data model, from
                    <strong>WeatherForecast.cs</strong> is working with the
                    <strong>WeatherForecastController</strong> to generate the data instance.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    Next, I made a new data model. The Student data model is just an example.
                    You can use the class model that you created previously. As part of the data
                    model, I created a mock data collection. Your data can be dummy data (like
                    this is) or you can use Entity Framework to connect to a database instance.
                </p>

            This section is also optional, but it does have value. I am providing this
            as reference for you to consider.
        </p>
        <p>
            Now that my code is working and successfully hosting my API requests locally,
            it would be beneficial if I could access this from the network. As a security
            measure, especially if you intende to have write (PUT/POST) access with your
            API, you should be aware of, and implement security for the API. In most
            cases, I would deploy the API as a cloud-hosted web service and limit firewall
            exceptions to my development IP address and the web application which is 
            intended to connect. That is an interesting discussion, but beyond the scope
            of this task, so considering the minimal risk. Here's a simple walk-through
            to deploy the API to the Azure cloud.

                    There are four inputs here.
                    <li>
                        Name. This needs to be unique. By default, it will use the project
                        name and a verbose date-time stamp. This could be useful, but it's 
                        not fun to type. I usually override with something simple, like just
                        project name. In this case I used MyDemoAPI1
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Subscription. I have a few that I use to track customer billable 
                        costs and other project reasons. If you have more than one, be sure 
                        the right one is selected. Most developers may have only one.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Resource Group. I always group my projects together in their own
                        resource groups. For many projects, multiple resources are created
                        and it is easier to manage them this way. (RG_MyDemoAPI1)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Subscription Plan. This one's important. By default, a very capable
                        configuration will be <em>recommended</em>. For production work, it 
                        is probably a reasonable choice. Since is this just a development
                        project and not intended for production, select New and change this
                        from the default. At the top of the list, you'll see that there is 
                        a Free tier available. I use this for the majority of my development
                        projects and have not encountered any limitations for any of those
                        testing environments.<strong>If you leave this in the default setting
                        you will incur costs on your Azure subscription.</strong>
                    </li>
                </ol>
            </li>
            <li>
                After the app service is created, the next step is to configure the API
                management section. Use the defaults for your app service and continue. 
                When it is complete, the Azure service will be created and ready to Deploy
                but the project has not yet been published.
            </li>
            <li>
                At this point, you can use the <strong>[Publish]</strong> button to send
                your project to your new cloud service. As you continue to work on your
                project, make changes and test locally, you'll be able to publish directly
                to this service. It only needs to be created the first time.
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>
                    When the API is deployed, Visual Studio may launch your default
                    browser with a connection to the web service. If the page is blank or 404,
                    check that the URL points to the correct endpoint.

        <p>
            Since there is no required API key or any firewall restrictions, the API data can 
            be accessed from anywhere on the internet, including mobile devices.

            Since this is deployed and currently accumulating no cost, and since the security 
            risk is low, it could conceivably be left running indefinitely, but since it is one
            of many development projects, I will regularly clean up and remove unused cloud
            services (by resource groups).
        </p>
        <p>
            Usually, the data source for the API would be accessing a live database. There are
            limited options when developing and testing projects at zero to near-zero cost. 
            I've used SQLite successfully for proof-of-cost projects. My preference would be
            to use a cloud-deployed RDBMS, like Azure SQL, but that comes at a cost, so for
            the proof of concept, I elected to mock-up the data for this example. The nice thing
            about the design is that the front-end application can be developed using this API,
            and then if the data source changes, the API can be updated with no change to the 
            web application.

        <ul>
            <li>
                Add your class model code to your project repository, and upload a screenshot 
                (of the code).
            </li>
            <li>
                Create an API (using the platform of your choice) and take a screenshot of 
                the http response.
            </li>
            <li>
                Add a <strong>Data Access Layer</strong> header to your project README and
                upload your screenshots there.
            </li>
            <li style="font-style:italic;">
                Optional: add the URL to your API as a comment to the submission page.
