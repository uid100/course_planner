    I know. Week 2-1/2 isn't really a thing. My goal is to provide at least weekly notices, but it's 
    really more of a guideline. *smile*</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    First, thank you for your patience. As you probably know by now, although the concept, outline and 
    design plan for the course is certainly planned, I'm developing a lot of the content from materials 
    I've collected or written, trying to make it a positive and beneficial experience, and not be tied 
    directly to a textbook. Some weeks are going to take me a little longer to assemble, some will be 
    ready much faster. I hope to have each module available at least a week or two ahead of the calendar 
    schedule, and hopefully more ahead than that later in the semester. As always, I welcome your feedback.

<p>Project step 1: Concept investigation</p>
<p>
    I was very impressed with your submissions. I appreciate the work and thought that went into these. 
    I'm genuinely looking forward to seeing the work that all of you produce.

    I mentioned in the last Announcement that I have several work areas at my home. This week by the way,
    many of those are looking chaotic. I have a couple of spaces (my office workstation for instance) 
    that are neat and where I can retreat, but I have too much going on in the garage and I need a few 
    days to put some things away. Anyone else need to clean their garage? (*sigh*)
</p>
<p>Anyway... to my point.</p>
<p>
    I really enjoyed your project ideas, and while you will be asked to build one of them out step-by-step 
    as we go through the semester, but that doesn't mean you need to limit your own development projects. 
    Just as I have different parallel projects in my garage, I also have several works-in-progress on 
    GitHub. Some are there because I took them as far as I needed to at the time, and I can use them as
    reference for future projects, some I may circle back to and develop further. Having multiple projects 
    is perfectly acceptable. And if you prefer, you can&nbsp;<em>close the garage door</em> by making the
    others private repositories. I have taught this curriculum on previous occasions and although it isn't 
    too often, it's also not uncommon for a student to get to a point and get frustrated or shift their 
    interest to another project. Of course the later in the semester we progress, the more difficult that 
    is. But if you have parallel projects that you are working, maybe because you are on the fence making 
    a decision or just have some extra time, having the extra projects might just come in handy.
</p>
<p>
    It's of course not a requirement or expectation to be working on multiple projects, but it is an 
    option.
