        <h2>Canvas</h2>
        <p>A lot of the material for this course is being updated for this semester. The impact is that much of it is in draft right now at the beginning of the semester. The outline and structure are complete and ready, but I'm working to get the final pages reviewed and published for you as quickly as I can.</p>
        <p>A couple of things that you need to know.</p>
        <p>You might find some errors. If something doesn't make sense, let me know. I've heard students express concern about&nbsp;<em>calling out&nbsp;</em>teachers on their mistakes. I'm asking you to help me review the course materials for your- and future class's benefit.</p>
        <p>Example: the ToDo list on module 1 was borrowed from another course and didn't make sense for the curriculum. I fixed it today.</p>
        <p>Module 2 should be ready tonight. I'll try and get Modules 3 and 4 done soon after.</p>
        <p>If you notice that some of the material is temporarily <em>locked</em> for your use in Canvas, that is why. If you have questions about what's coming up, please ask. I'm happy to visit during office hours, or leave a note in the class Discord channel. Of course email works too, but if you have the question, chances are others do too.</p>

    <h2>Projects</h2>
        <p>This course is about building something.</p>
        <p>But more importantly, about&nbsp;<em>how&nbsp;</em>to build something.&nbsp; Each individual and team project that you undertake will be tailored to its own set of processes. The steps that we walk through for this project are typical and representational, but not universal.</p>
        <p>We'll build some artifacts and ultimately be staging project progress, documents, and status updates on GitHub. During the course, these will be staged on a public repository, visible to me and to others. As a software developer, a link to your GitHub repositories is likely part of your resume (or CV).</p>
        <h3>Works in progress</h3>
        <p>I am very fortunate to have a variety of workspaces at my home. With the kids grown and gone, my wife and I enjoy a dedicated office space where both work. I'm very thankful to have gotten our desks set up, monitors and workstations configured to our needs. I know that many, especially during COVID, work from home on kitchen tables and living room couches with kids or roommates walking though these shared space.</p>
        <p>Down the hall, we have a 3-car garage. In addition to our cars (yes, we actually park in it), we have workbenches and craft countertops arranged around different work areas. In full disclosure, one of my so-called workbenches collects&nbsp;<em>stuff.</em> I haven't seen that countertop in years. But at least a couple of the workspaces in my garage are routinely cleared off, tools put away and available when new projects come in the door. Sometimes I have circuit boards torn apart and a soldering and wiring station is set up. Currently I'm working on a bathroom remodel, and last week I had plumbing parts spread out while I was assembling and soldering the copper fittings that were installed in the new shower. When the radiator on my car decided it had had enough, there was a space available to organize parts and tools until the car repair was complete. Sometimes it's welding, sometimes it's cabinetry, sometimes it's lawnmower repair, sometimes sailboat rigging.</p>
        <p>If you visit my garage today, you'll see (at least) 1 car, 1 motorcycle, 3 bicycles, and for this week, my wife's car is parked out in the driveway because I have several large plywood storage boxes in various stages of being painted before they get put away. These are storage crates for Christmas decorations. I'll get those done soon. But there are also other projects in progress on a couple of workbenches. This is my garage. In addition to parking cars, it's a workspace, not a showroom.&nbsp;</p>
        <p>The point is at any time I may have several projects in progress. And, they are much easier to accomplish when each has its own work and staging area.</p>
        <h3>GitHub</h3>
        <p>That is the what GitHub is for.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>
        <h4>git</h4>
        <p><strong>git</strong> was created by&nbsp;<strong>Linus Torvalds.</strong> Yes,&nbsp;<em>that&nbsp;</em>Linus Torvalds. They say that necessity is the mother of invention. Incidentally, this is a paraphrase from Plato's Republic from 2400 years ago. Being one of the founding proponents of <em>open source </em>software, he needed a better tool for managing collaborative work on many projects. <strong>GitHub</strong> was created as a web-based API to host a&nbsp;<em>git</em> server. For our purposes, think of it as an extra workbench, or several, where we can stage and work on projects.</p>
        <p>Why is that important? I've had many students express concern about having their project repositories&nbsp;<em>public.</em> I've heard complaints such as, <em>it's not ready to be shared with others</em> yet.</p>
        <p>or</p>
        <p><em>It's not finished.&nbsp;</em></p>
        <p>Again, it's a workbench</p>
        <p>GitHub is a workspace, not a showroom. Use it to collect objects while you are building them, not when they are finished. Together, we will try to keep them ordered and organized.</p>
        <p>I have well over 100 GitHub repositories. Some are public, most are not. Some are forgotten and abandoned projects. Sometimes I revisit and delete or merge them with others. Like my garage, some <em>workbenches&nbsp;</em>I haven't looked at in a very long time.</p>
