        <h3>
            <em>A plan is a point of departure</em>
        </h3>
        <p>
            I race sailboats. I've raced many different classes of highly competitive
            boats from small dinghies to large keelboats with crews from one or two
            to fifteen to twenty. Success in racing requires the same fundamental
            truths as success in any other sport, development project, or business
            venture. Preparation, planning and execution. And success teaches us
            that these cannot be separated.
        </p>
        <p>
            For us, success starts long before the starting line. Preparation means
            the equipment is ready: correctly selected, installed, and maintained.
            It means that the team is well-selected and compatible with the objective
            and members are individually prepared for the task. It means understanding
            the environment, including knowing what is, and isn't in the local charts
            and weather reports. It includes tracking local and regional weather
            observations and forecasts and tide schedules and current patterns
            for changes over time . All of this adds up to showing up the
            day of a race with a well-planned and communicated strategy, including
            knowing what to do when our well-planned and communicated strategy
            goes right out the window because of changes to what we expected during
            our planning.

            <dd>
                is knowing how to deal with the reality
                that conditions and situations change.

        <p>
            It is good to plan.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is best to know how to adjust your plan when what you thought you knew
            doesn't happen.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this module, we'll revisit what <em>planning</em> means in software
            engineering, and how we, as an industry, went so wrong.

            We started out this course talking about the SDLC, and the different phases
            of the life cycle, how requirements analysis leads to design. And 
            an approved design should be completed before implementation. And
            that a solution should be fully tested and delivered to the customer
            in a neat, handoff, with a transition to maintenance and support 
            activities.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's a great idea.
        </p>
        <p> Where it usually fails is in the application (of that idea).
        </p>
        <p>
            First, the notion that there will be an end to one phase leading 
            to the beginning of the next, usually needs to be an ongoing,
            cooperative conversation rather than a clean handoff.
        </p>
        <p>
            Next, is that it needs to be recognized that planning is based on
            assumptions and predictions, which can vary in their accuracy.

                Twenty years ago, a rift between engineering and project management
                teams was growing silently across the industry.
            </p>
            <p>
                Process <em>scientists</em> had studied and designed and redesigned
                approaches to completing projects which followed measurable and
                predictable formulae, and the world had subscribed to it. We, as
                industry professionals would decompose project objectives into
                measurable granula requirements, which could, in theory, be forecast
                and with estimated with some degree of certainty, and these small
                efforts would then be rolled up and sequenced with entry and exit
                criteria and progress could be monitored, measured, and reported
                against that plan and overall project success could be ensured.
            </p>
            <div class="ic-flash-info">
            <p>
                A fundamental flaw was that project success was measured against that
                imperfect plan, rather then the project objectives themselves.

                At this time, a group of successful engineers organized a meeting
                to discuss these frustrations. They did
                not provide solutions. Rather, they defined the developed a set of
                principles which became <em>revolutionary</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Process and design documents and meetings are all important parts of
                product development, but this group formally authored a set of
                ideas that emphasized that these documents and artifacts are
                <em>secondary</em> products to <em>support</em> the solution development
                effort, not the products themselves.

            <h2 class="alert">What needs to change?</h2>
            <h3>A real world example</h3>
            <p>
                About the time this was taking place, I was working on a project that
                had run into delays and execution problems in the first contract year.
                Our company, a large contrating company, was successful and took pride
                in excellence in program execution. When something was wrong, we took
                action and fixed it. Still, with a large contract and a larger customer,
                There are a lot of formally defined gates and processes to be followed.
                We dilligently authored and followed processes and were the model
                project team, setting examples for others to follow. At the end of the 
                second year, the customer was very happy, we were back on schedule, showing
                a profit for the company and proudly looking forward to delivering a 
                quality product.
            </p>
            <p>
                The frustration was that by the time design, development, test, training
                and deployment were complete, the program was in its 4th year. But the 
                pre-contract award proposal activity had taken about 9 months. The original 
                Operational Concept Document (OCD) on which our requirements had been based
                was written and approved about 2 years prior to that. So from recognizing 
                the user need to final delivery, almost 7 years had passed. 
            </p>
            <p>
                This is not an unusual scenario. 7 years is a lifetime in technology, but
                our industry had been perpetuating this pattern. All of the processes were
                carefully developed to ensure best practices, but feeding the machine had
                quietly become more important than meeting customer objectives within a
                reasonable time.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                If you read the simple document that these engineers called their 
                <em>Manifesto</em>, you'll recognize that these design documents and 
                meetings and reviews all certainly had value, but these needed to be
                used for 2-way communication and reaching understanding, not viewed as
                the delivery objectives themselves.
            </p>
            <blockquote>
                <em>while there is value in the items on the right, 
                we value the items on the left more</em>
            </blockquote>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                As I said before, in this course, we began with a discussion of the 
                SDLC and a discussion about some of the artifacts that are produced
                in many large projects. It is important to recognize that there is a
                correct way to do these, and that they serve a purpose, but what we
                are learning is that if they are always labeled <em>DRAFT</em> that
                might be ok.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                At the time this <em>Manifesto</em> was written, many thought it had 
                some good ideas, but there were also those who thought these engineers 
                were anarchists and it took a very long time for anything to change.
            </p>
            <p>
                Remember that nowhere in this ideal of becoming more
                agile in software development processes, did this group make any 
                suggestions about how this should be done.
            </p>
            <p>
                Some were proponents of eXtreme Programming (XP), Kanban and time-boxes
                had been around for a while already, as had scrum. But for large
                companies and large customers, these ideas were not considered viable.
                They certainly didn't fit the predictable, repeatable measures of
                success they were used to.
            </p>
            <p>
                As these ideals began to be more mainstream there were a lot of discussions
                and efforts for projects to become more lean and agile and able to adjust
                more quickly to changes in requirements and directions.
            </p>
            <p>
                In my own opinion and observations, the one thing that distinguishes
                many of these practices with traditional processes is the more frequent
                feedback loop. Traditionally, review events were often week- or two-week
                long events attended by many participants. The presentations were polished
                <em>finalized</em> documents intended for official sign-off. These meetings
                became rehearsed presenations because schedule setbacks could be costly.
                In contrast, instead of these large, infrequent formal meetings, teams
                trying to be more agile, are meeting frequently and presenting current-state,
                implementations. Instead of formal finalized documents, <em>just-enough</em>
                designs are presented. Just enough to get started. Just enough to build the
                next feature or the next view.
            </p>
            <p>
                Instead of waiting for a grand-unveiling, the customer-stakeholders see small
                incremental changes. Teams are smaller, and decisions are faster.
            </p>
            <p class="ic-flash-info">
                <em>Agile</em> is an adjective, not a noun!
            </p>
            <p>
                Organizations don't <em>"Do Agile"</em> they try to <em>become more agile.</em>
            </p>
            <h2 class="alert">Scrum</h2>
            <p>
                With all of this in mind, several methodologies have made strides in trying
                to improve process. One of these is Scrum. I have led teams who have followed
                this approach on small and large projects. With time, training, and tailoring
                it can be quite effective.
            </p>
            <p>
                I have shared this short video training with my students and my engineering
                teams. This is one of my favorite and most useful instructional videos for
                engineering teams. This 15-minute video is the first of a series, but it is
                definitely worthwhile information for anyone looking to join a software engineering
                team. There is a lot of good information here, and you may want to return to 
                this one and watch it again in the future.
