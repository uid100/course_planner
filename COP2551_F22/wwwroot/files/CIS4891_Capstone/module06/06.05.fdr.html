        <p>
            At this point, you have developed a number of typical design
            artifacts in your GitHub repository. These have all been arranged
            in your project README.md file.
        </p>
        <p>
            I asked you to add a header with each of the sections you added.
            Take a few minutes now to add a table of contents near the top 
            of the document. With defined headers in your markdown document
            it is really quite straightforward to do, and it will help you
            see your project's organization at a glance. Help doing that
            can be found 
                <a href="https://www.setcorrect.com/portfolio/work11/" style="color:navy;">
                    here.

        </p>
        <p style="font-style:italic;">
            The design documents in your readme will tell a visitor a story and communicate
            your vision for your project application.

            It may seem confusing. For several weeks, I've asked you to take the time to
            develop design documents and artifacts, tables of requirements and UML drawings.
            Then in this module, I introduced the ideas that as an industry, we need to 
            become more <em>agile</em> with more focus on product and less on process and
            documentation.
        </p>
        <p>
            But really these are not mutually exclusive. In some of those projects I mentioned,
            we kept a team of 5 or 6 engineers full-time employed working on requirements
            management and design documentation for years at a time. I've delivered Detailed
            Design Documentation (DDD) and System Requirements Specification (SRS) documents
            that were many hundreds of pages long adhering to strict formal standards. These
            are not bad things and they are not going away.
        </p>
        <p>
            What I am suggesting, as the <b>scrum</b> video you just saw indicated, we still 
            need to create the design and the requirements, but rather than assume an end-to-end
            vision, we need
            <ul>
                <li><em>just enough</em> planning to start</li>
                <li>and <em>just enough</em> design to begin implementation</li>
                <li>and <em>just enough</em> requirements to develop our test cases.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            It's still good to have a plan, but we need to plan to get started quickly.

            Among the goals of our preliminary design review was collaboration. The hope is
            make our projects better by active <em>and</em> passive observations. Maybe it 
            was helpful feedback from one of your peers, maybe a suggestion of something to
            fix, improve, or just consider from another viewpoint. Or it was less intentional,
            maybe it wasn't direct feedback, but an observation of something you saw on another
            repository that you'd like to emulate or replicate. We're all here to learn from 
            each other!
        </p>
        <p>
            This week, there will be one more design challenge (on a separate page) to be 
            added to your project, but first, implement the changes and updates and suggestions
            to your project from the previous review. Add your table of contents, and share
            it again with others.
        </p>

        <h2 class="alert">Instructions</h2>
        <h3>Initial Post (25 points)</h3>
        <p style="background-color:yellow;">
            Complete this initial post not later than Wednesday night,
            so that others have time for their review.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this discussion activity, your initial post should
            contain a link to your repository (and the README), and 
            a brief paragraph describing the project and the current
            status of the design documents. This may the same that you
            used before.
        </p>
        <p>
            Add another paragraph of something that you've updated or
            changed based on feedback or an observation from another 
            page. Typially, the "final design review (FDR)" is a follow-up
            to the "preliminary design review (PDR)." It begins with a list
            of action items from the last review that needed to be closed
            and the objective is demonstration that they have been addressed.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h3>Next (25 points each)</h3>
        <p>
            Once again review 3 other students' projects and
            provide thoughtful, meaningful feedback, questions, and
            suggestions. This might also include something that you've
            learned from that student's project thay you'd either like
            to include or have already.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sharing of information is a good thing. Some students
            may be inspired by some of the work others are doing and
            might employ some of the ideas from them. This collaborative
            work benefits all of us. As a group, it should be a goal
            to make all of these projects as professional as possible.
        </p>
        <p>
            All projects benefit from diverse perspectives. As always,
            keep your comments respectful.
        </p>
        <p>
            Note: This is a review of a document and project in progress.
            Even this week, more is being added to the repository. The
            review should focus on the completed design artifacts first.
        </p>
        <p class="ic-flash-info">
            Don't be misled by the name <em>final</em> design review.
            All design artifacts should be considered draft unless they
            require customer approval signatures.
