        <p>
            <em><strong>One</strong></em> definition is an early sample, model, or release 
            of a product built to test a concept or process. Prototyping is an important 
            component in Agile software design and development providing early realization 
            or model of a concept.
        </p>
        <p>
            Functionality is not required or expected, but rather the prototype model is 
            useful for communicating and developing a concept for consideration and evolution.
        </p>
        <p>
            A prototype may be constructed to meet one (or many of) the a project's top 
            level requirements (from User Stories), with preference given to ideal scenario 
            processing rather than edge-case and error handling.
        </p>
        <p>For example:</p>
        <h3>User Stories</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <em><strong>As a</strong></em><span>&nbsp;</span>busy mobile professional,
            </li>
            <li>
                <em><strong>I need</strong></em><span>&nbsp;</span>the ability to securely 
                transfer funds between bank accounts on-the-go
            </li>
            <li>
                <em><strong>So that</strong></em><span>&nbsp;</span>I don't need to drive 
                to the bank during business hours and my accounts remain secure.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <h3>Requirements</h3>
        <table class="table table-success table-striped">
            <caption>requirements</caption>
            <thead>

                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>1.</td>
                    <td>Provide secure access to bank accounts</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1.1</td>
                    <td>The system shall enable a secure login capability</td>

                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>1.3</td>
                    <td>The system shall display the balance in each of the customer's accounts</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2.</td>
                    <td>Provide ability to transfer funds between available accounts</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2.1</td>
                    <td>The system shall provide an interface for transferring available funds between accounts</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2.1.1</td>
                    <td>The system provide a form to select the account from which to transfer funds, the target account to receive the transfer, and the amount to transfer</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2.1.2</td>
                    <td>The transfer page shall limit the amount of the transfer to the amount available in the account</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>
                    <td>2.1.3</td>
                    <td>The system shall reduce the displayed available balance by the amount of the transfer after it is confirmed</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <p>
            The prototype interface should include each of the pages (forms) needed to complete 
            the transaction and be appropriate and adequate to display the functionality. External 
            interfaces are not required or expected to be functional. Data should be within expected 
            values, but may be temporary values substituted for live data.
        </p>
        <hr />

        <h3>Submission</h3>
        <p>
            For this step, submit the URL for the github project repository and a comment indicating 'ready for review.'
            Within the repository make a folder called prototype and a (separate) readme, which includes a narrative with 
            screenshot images or links to HTML documents outlining the functionality of the prototype.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sketches or mockups are acceptable at this stage. If you are comfortable creating HTML code at this
            point, it will be a helpful headstart for later.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's important to contain the prototype in a separate (or sub-) folder to clearly identify this as a 
            prototype with no expetation for finished functionality.
