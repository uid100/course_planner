            Visual Studio has helpful tools that enable the developer to see the content
            and state of every object in your code while it executes, and even pause the
            process and continue one step at a time to see how the values change. This is
            very helpful and relatively easy to understand when you are writing simple,
            single-threaded applications. But what happens when you start an ASP.NET web
            application which is designed to continously listen and respond to multiple
            events and generate responses from different components?
        </p>
        <p>
            Chapter 5 will walk you through tools and techniques to identify and fix issues
            in your code and highlight some common problems that you may encounter.
        </p>
        <p>
            In Chapter 5, you will learn how to use the Visual Studio debugging tool for
            web apps. You will also learn how to use your browser's developer tools to
            analyze the HTML and CSS for your web pages. The tools presented in this chapter
            offer a way for you to manually test an app. For more complex apps, Chapter 14
            describes how to automate the testing for your apps. We do not cover Chapter 14
            in COP4813 but feel free to review Chapter 14 to increase your knowledge of the
            automated testing process.

            This chapter is good study and reference material. If some of it is hard to
            follow, make note of where the material is, so that you can return to it when
            needed.

            Do not forget about your web application.
        </p>

            We have spent some time focusing on data models, making views which are 
            "strongly-typed" (and what that means!) and how to send that data between the 
            controller and the view and back again.
        </p>
        <p>
            We learned about responsive design and how to make your application friendly
            for mobile devices (first!) and also scale up to tablets and larger displays.
        </p>

            Using Entity Framework, the text book walked through using the (EF) tool to
            automatically generate ("migrate") database tables from data model classes, 
            and how to automatically create ("scaffold") data class code from existing
            database tables. Entity Framework does the hard part, but it works both ways,
            "code-first" (to migrate to tables) and "data-first" (to scaffold code from 
            db tables). And this tool works with many different popular database management
            systems, including SQL, Oracle, SQLite, MySQL, and others.

            Revisit your application idea(s). Based on what you have seen and read, does
            it change your vision? Do you want to build more? Scale it back? try something
            new? Keep making sketches of your ideas and refining the concept(s). You do not
            have to limit to one, but you do need to elaborate on at least one. What are 
            the inputs and outputs? What will it look like. What is the data that you will
            be representing on your pages. What will you store in your database table(s)?
