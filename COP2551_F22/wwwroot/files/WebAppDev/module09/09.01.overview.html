            When you started writing computer applications, you probably saw 
            and practiced sequential processing steps. You could walk through
            your code step by step and track how each variable and counter 
            might change along the way. With web applications, the application
            starts a listening service. As soon as a connection is made, a new
            listening process starts up to replace the previous one which is
            now busy handling the request, and the process continues by calling
            the method that corresponds to the HTTP request. Each of those 
            "listeners" handles whatever request is made to it, with no context
            of what happened before.
        </p>
        <p>
            Look at it another way. Imagine that you walk up to a professional
            sports venue, football stadium, baseball park, hockey arena, take
            your pick... And there are 10 ticket windows. You approach the window
            and purchase four tickets for that evening. The attendant processes
            your transaction and (imagine) steps away and a new attendant steps
            back to the window. If you want to purchase tickets for that event
            or any other, it is a brand new transaction which has no connection
            to the previous request and purchased tickets. Remember, that first
            attendant walked away and was replaced by this one. You might as 
            well have gone to a different window, which right now is busy handling
            another transaction. This is how our web application works. Each
            request is brand new with no context and no connection to any previous
            request.
        </p>
        <p>
            Read that again.
        </p>
        <p>
            HTTP - Hyper Text Transfer Protocol, is said to be a "stateless" 
            protocol. That means that every transaction is handled separately from
            every other transaction. Your application can handle one user or one
            hundred and twenty-one users at the same time and each one is handled
            separately, even if you click from one page to another!
        </p>
        <p>
            That is <em>really</em> important to understand.
        </p>
        <p>
            But wait(!) if I add a box of laundry soap to my Amazon shopping cart 
            and then browse for a set of motorcycle tires, and then walk away and
            log back in on my iPhone, Amazon knows all about me, what I was shopping
            for, and what I still have waiting to purchase. And the continuous loop
            of Amazon delivery trucks in my neighborhood suggests that there were 
            at least a few other customers logged in during that time.
        </p>
        <p>
            When a user makes a request from a web application, in order to provide
            a custom, correct response to each request, there needs to be some way
            to keep track of connections from request to request, and to do it as
            efficiently as possible. This is why we have session state data and 
            (request) cookies.

        <p>
            Although nothing is due to be submitted for credit this week, take the 
            time to practice the sample code in the book. 
        </p>
        <p>
            As you have seen, this topic and this textbook is packed full of 
            information. It is understandable that there will be some details and
            concepts that slip past us the first time around. It is however important 
            to grasp enough so that when you need to apply these ideas later, that
            you will recognize what they are and where to find the information. And
            it may be very true that this textbook becomes a valuable reference that
            you can return to, if you know where to look for answers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes, knowing what questions to ask, and where to find the answers
            is enough.
