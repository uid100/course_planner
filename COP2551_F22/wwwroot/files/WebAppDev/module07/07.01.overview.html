        <p>
            Previously, we mentioned the difference between web pages and web applications. We
            said that like other computer applications, web applications have input, processing threads
            and dynamic output, in contrast with web pages, which are typically simple, static text
            documents which are usually formatted using HTML tags.
        </p>
        <p>
            Throughout the book, you have worked through examples of passing data through an http
            protocol request, usually from a browser, which then gets processed, and directed to an
            action method which in turn passes its data to a Razor view which has a ".cshtml" file
            extension. This <em>hybrid</em> file has both html and c# components. It is easy to be
            confused by this file. It is not the output of the program (yet.) The data gets passed
            to this page and the Razor view engine processes this file and outputs an HTML file which
            is then passed as the response to the browsers request. ASP takes care of that for us.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Razor views are not web pages.</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            If you run any of the MVC web apps that we have created, and view the result in Chrome
            web browser (for instance) and select F12 to view the page source, you can see the familiar
            "!DOCTYPE html" header, "head", "body", maybe "heading" and "table" tags, but none of the
            c# code, such as foreach and if statements that might have been in the Razor view.
        </p>
        <p>
            With practice, you have written web pages using html and css, with the Razor view engine
            you can write the instructions for creating those pages.

            Although nothing is due to be submitted for credit this week, take the time to practice
            the sample code in the book. Visit Discord and share your discoveries and questions.

            Do you have more insights or ideas about your student-led web application project? 
            Sometimes whiteboard sketches or page drawings can help clarify what your pages should 
            look like and what kind of data they will contain. The Github README is a great place
            to collect your notes as you shape the direction your project is going.
