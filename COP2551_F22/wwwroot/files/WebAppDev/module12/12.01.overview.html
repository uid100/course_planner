        <p>
            Entity Framework is a powerful suite of tools that handle much of 
            the heavy lifting required for the interface between your .NET app
            and a database.
        </p>
        <p>
            A couple of important takeaways to remember.
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <em>Migrations</em> - read through your compiled code and build the scripts
                    to create or update your database schema to ensure they match your code 
                    <em>exactly!</em>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <em>Scaffolding</em> - analyzes an existing database schema and generates
                    the code to describe data models to match the table entities <em>exactly!</em>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            EF does those things and more. You do not have to use Entity Framework to migrate
            your class models to db tables. You do not have to use EF to generate code to match
            your existing database schema. You can create your own tables and write your own 
            code and still use Entity Framework to link them together. Just make sure they match
            <em>exactly!</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            You can even use both! You can create your tables, scaffold your data model code
            (auto-generated code), and then modify the code to your liking and then migrate 
            the changes back to the database and go back and forth until both match what you
            want them to be.
        </p>

        <h4>Code First</h4>
        <p>
            When you hear the term <em>"code first"</em> it means that the class models are 
            written in code (C#) and then the tool is called to create or modify the db schema
            using <em>migrations</em>.
        </p>

        <h4>Database First</h4>
        <p>
            <em>Database first</em> means that you are writing code to match an existing database
            schema. Often, you will not be able to modify existing database table designs because
            other apps and other users are already using them and storing data in them. This is
            common. You can write your code to match the tables, or you can let EF <em>scaffold</em>
            the code and you can build around it.
        </p>
