        <h3>My Web App: User Interface</h3>
        <h4>UI/UX</h4>
        <p>
            In your studies, you have seen and followed different patterns
            and frameworks and models. Programming logic often begins with
            pseudocode, unconcerned with syntax and coding standards, this
            method is a freeform discussion to walk through processing steps.
        </p>
        <p>
            Flowcharts became a standard in manufacturing during the industrial
            revolution and have undergone many <em>standards</em> revisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Commonly in software engineering, Unified Modeling Language
            (UML) diagrams are used to communicate structural and behavioral
            dimensions of an application. Selections among these design tools
            vary from situation to situation, and organization to organization.
        </p>
        <p>
            As a part of the design process, peer review is often included
            even for these early artifacts and it may come as a surprise how
            often logic and data errors and issues can be corrected early,
            well before solution implementation.

            For graphical applications, <em>wireframe</em> drawings are often
            used to help plan, communicate, and visualize not only the user
            interface, but also the data logic. Often, a whiteboard sketch
            of screen (view) after screen after screen, may reveal an oversight
            in which data element is needed from one processing step to another
            or identify which data properties need to be populated and validated
            at which phase of the process. It can even help steer architecture
            and component structure.
        </p>
        <p class="alert">
            <em>Wow, that is a lot!</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            It is. Sometimes, ideas may start out as sketches on a restaurant
            napkin and be refined on a whiteboard in a conversation with
            stakeholders. The customer may not know the ideal solution until
            they see the wrong one(s). The engineering team may be aware of
            all the latest technology, but not have a clear vision of the
            user&apos;s environment.

        The main purpose of the wireframe drawing is to communicate an
        idea, and to confirm that the design is logical. It needs to make
        sense and be simple to the user, it also needs to ensure that the
        data required to render each view is available when it is needed.

    <h4>Wireframes</h4>
    <p>
        As part of your ongoing web project development, you will develop
        two or three page designs for your application. These can be done
        in html(and css) code or may be sketches. My preferred drawing
        tool for this is the <em>sketchy</em> template in the web-based
        draw.io tool.
    </p>
    <p>
        Whichever tool you select to create your graphical concept, be 
        sure to <strong>save the drawings as image file(s).</strong>

            Create renderings of at least two pages of your application to
            illustrate the process flow from the user perspective.

                    You may create a login page if it is relevant to your 
                    application, but it will not be counted as one of the 
                    at least two required pages.

            The pages are intended to demonstrate what data will be collected
            or presented step-by-step as the user steps through your application.

            Add the image files to your README in your Github repository. 
            you can search for [github markdown cheatsheet] for help including
            images in markdown files.

            Your wireframes and/or User Interface drawings should have appropriate

                    the design and development process. Your responses should
                    contain professional constructive criticism and add value.
