        <p>
            In chapter 2, we looked at how to validate data for simple 
            scenarios like making sure a user has entered a value for a 
            field and making sure the value falls within a specified range. 
            This chapter reviews those skills and presents some more 
            advanced skills for validating data, including how to create 
            custom data attributes, and how to make custom validation work 
            on both the client and the server.
        </p>

        <h4>References</h4>
        <p>
            The System.ComponentModel.DataAnnotations in ASP.NET provides
            many options and support for data validation. The textbook is 
            a good place to start. Remember that the .NET platform and the 
            C# language is an evolving world. Microsoft documentation should
            be the most up-to-date. Be aware that the documents should 
            be specific to the correct version numbers. A big part of working
            in the world of moving standards is knowing where to find the
            answers. Pay attention to dates and version numbers in your
            search results.

            As before, the best recommendation is to read through the chapter
            and try the examples. Although we will not be submitting anything
            this week for assessment, building and running the examples from
            the book are the best way to see how they interact with your
            applications and other components. At the end of the chapter, try
            Exercise 11-1. In my experience, making mistakes while practicing 
            is the best way to learn to apply the concepts.
