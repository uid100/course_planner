        Practice, practice, practice. That is how you learn anything. The textbook
        we have chosen is a tremendous resource which contains a lot of detailed
        information about many of the aspects of building web apps following the
        MVC pattern and hosted in ASP.NET.
    </p>
    <p>
        In this course, I encouraged you to think about projects which could be
        built as a web application. We looked at concept development and requirements
        definition. As part of project setup, we setup a Github repository for source
        control management and documents. And we creatied wireframe designs for the
        UI/UX to clarify logic and to aid in communicating the concept to others for
        peer review.

    <h2 class="alert alert-info">Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)</h2>
    <p>
        The SDLC is an important concept in Software Engineering. It is a logicical,
        structured, phased process approach to software development.
    </p>
    <p>
        Read that again.
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Logical</li>
        <li>Structured</li>
        <li>Phased</li>
        <li>Process</li>
    </ul>
    <p>
        This is well established and widely accepted.
    </p>
    <p>
        Take a moment and launch a web search for "SDLC." The results may surprise you.
        For such a fundamental concept in our industry, it is a little confusing (to me)
        that there is not consensus on just what these phases are or even how many steps,
        stages, phases there are!
    </p>
    <p>
        What is agreed is that the process (life cycle) begins with defining and planning
        the product and process, followed by designing the solution, then implementation,
        testing, and maintaining. Each of these activities is worthy of deeper investigation
        on their own and perspectives may change some from project to project, and the
        boundaries between the activities may blur and shift from project to project.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3>Waterfall</h3>
    <p>
        For many years the "gold standard" has been to follow a strict sequential process
        for all large, formal engineering processes. Just as water <em>flows</em> downhill
        in only one direction between vertical changes, the waterfall engineering process
        is intended to be a single direction, sequence of steps.
    </p>
    <p>
        This is characterized by clear start and end conditions for each phase of development.
        Usually there is a formal review of defined artifacts which represent formal entry
        and exit criteria for each stage.
    </p>
    <p>
        A Planning Review would ensure that a project was correctly resourced and authorize 
        funding and a kickoff for the next steps.
    </p>
    <p>
        A Requirements review with customer and other stakeholders would provide an initial
        agreement of what the product&apos;s goals and objectives.
    </p>
    <p>    
        The design team (usually system engineers) would work to describe an acceptable 
        design from the formal requirements and may have a series of Preliminary Design 
        Reviews and a Final Design Review.
    </p>
    <p>
        Not until this final design is reviewed and approved would the developers begin 
        to implement the solution. This implementation of course does include interim 
        unit and integration testing, but concludes before final formal acceptance testing.
    </p>
    <p>
        The support and maintenance phase also has many activities associated with it.
    </p>
    <p>
        In a perfect world, the waterfall process is an excellent model to follow and manage.
        In reality, there are significant challenges with it. It is difficult to predict all
        of the details that will be involved when constructing a complex system. Often this
        leads to ratcheting back to earlier phases to make adjustments.
    </p>
    <p>
        If a requirement needs to be revisited, fixed, or clarified during the implementation
        phase, for instance, the design may need to be reviewed and updated, and other
        implications on the system may need to be considered. This occasional interruption
        of the single directional process flow is one of the biggest challenges of the
        waterfall process.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3>Agile (Scrum/Kanban/XP)</h3>
    <p>
        In the software engineering world, there is still some confusion about the term
        <em>agile.</em> It is a movement which was launched by a conference of software
        engineers looking for ways to improve the software process. At the end of their
        discussion, they concluded that product (good code) should be prioritized over
        process (artifacts). Simply put, they respected and appreciated the logical
        activities: concept definition, requirements, design, implementation, test, and
        maintenance, but recommended that, as an industry, there needed to be a reasonable
        and logical approach to handling changes, rather than the rigid, single-direction
        waterfall model.
    </p>
    <p>
        That&apos;s it. They published their recommendations, but did not include any
        suggestions for how to do this.
    </p>
    <p>
        As a result of this call for a more <em>Agile</em> approach, several alternatives
        were proposed. Most notably:
        <ul>
            <li>Kanban</li>
            <li>Scrum</li>
            <li>eXtreme Programming (XP)</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>Kanban</h4>
    <p>
        <em>Kanban</em> is a Japanese term which means (approximately) "bulletin board"
        or "sign board." The concept is to decompose a project into small tasks and post
        them in a shared location. Team members select from the tasks (cards) on the todo
        list, one at a time. The task (card) visibly will move from the todo list to a
        list indicating that it is assigned and actively being worked. The team member will
        then work the task to completion and move it to the next column to indicate it is
        complete and (usually) ready for testing, and will retrieve another task (card).
    </p>
    <p>
        The concept was made popular from documented processes in Japanese automobile
        manufacturing, designed to optimize productivity and eliminating activities seen
        as wasteful. <em>"The Toyota Way"</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        While team members are cycling through the tasks on the todo list and moving
        them across the board, a product owner (usually) will be managing the task backlog
        and providing new tasks to the board, opening new tasks, and reviewing the completed
        tasks and either closing them or reopening them if it is needed.
    </p>
    <p>
        If you are-, or someone you know is- a list-maker, you will appreciate the value
        of this approach. The key points are to keep an acheivable but not overwhelming
        list of tasks available, and having a team disciplined to maintain focus on 1
        (maybe 2) task(s) at a time.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>Scrum</h4>
    <p>
        The term <em>Scrum</em> comes from the game of rugby and the manner of play which
        involves coordinated effort of a formation of players. This idea that a team can
        form and manage themselves is central to scrum approach to development. In this
        model, a fixed amount of time is defined, usually about 2 weeks, and as a team,
        there is a set amount of work that is to be accomplished.
    </p>
    <p>
        Within each defined time period, called "sprints," the team works together to
        design, implement, and test the associated goals for the sprint. The goal of
        each sprint is to have a testable product which will evolve toward the final
        objective with each successive sprint.
    </p>
    <p>
        During the sprint, there are regular checkpoints to communicate direction and
        progress to ensure the team and stakeholders remain on a correct course.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4>Extreme Programming (XP)</h4>
    <p>
        Some of the principles of XP include Pair Programming and parallel testing. With
        Pair Programming, engineers work collaboratively, sharing ideas and actively
        communicating and peer reviewing and testing production as the product is being
        developed. This approach relies on following industry best practices and requires
        considerable trust and clear communication to ensure design direction is consistent
        with customer intent.
