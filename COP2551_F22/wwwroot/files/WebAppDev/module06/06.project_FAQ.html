            For this project, you will build a multi-page, data driven app with multiple routes like the one 
            shown below. You can start your project with either the MVC template or the empty template. Save 
            the files in a folder named, <strong>6-1_FAQs</strong>. Add comments including your name, etc. to 
            the top of the pages and comments throughout the pages to describe the changes/edits/updates that 
            were made.

        <ul>
            <li>
                When the app starts, it should display a list of all frequently asked questions (FAQs).
            </li>
            <li>
                The Home page should have a Bootstrap navbar across the top with links that filter the FAQs
                by topic. One of the links should clear any filtering and display all the FAQs.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Home page should have a Bootstrap list group to the left of the list of FAQs with links
                that filter the FAQs by category.
            </li>
            <li>
                Here’s how the filtering should work:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        On initial load, or when the user clicks the All FAQs link, the app should display
                        all the FAQs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When the user clicks a category link, the app should filter FAQs by category. If the
                        user subsequently clicks a topic link, the FAQs will be filtered by topic and by category.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        When the user clicks a topic link, the app should filter FAQs by topic. If the user
                        subsequently clicks a category link, the app should filter the FAQs by topic and by
                        category.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                Use custom routes to create the links for filtering. Use static segments to distinguish the
                topic route from the category route.
            </li>
            <li>
                The FAQ model class should have a primary key that’s generated by the database.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Topic and Category model classes should have primary keys that are strings. Use primary key
                values that will be user friendly in a URL.
            </li>
            <li>
                The FAQ class should have foreign key fields that relate it to the Topic and Category classes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use EF Code First and migrations to create a database based on your model classes. Include seed
                data for the topics, categories, and FAQs. (You can copy the data shown above, or you can create
                your own topics, categories, and FAQs.)
            </li>
            <li>
                The URLs for the app should be lowercase with trailing slashes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Zip the folders and files and upload the zipped 6-1_Faqs folder to the Module 6 Drop box in 
                Canvas.
            </li>
        </ul>
