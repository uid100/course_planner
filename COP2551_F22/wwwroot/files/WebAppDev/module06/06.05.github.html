    <p>
        Through each chapter, we have walked through sample code highlighting new concepts and then working 
        on related projects which build on the idea and use the same methods to create a similar but solution.
    </p>
    <p>
        The assigned projects have included project specification, and sometimes a sample sketch of what the 
        completed solution might look like. The instructions are intended to give an overall picture of the 
        project objective and the preliminary design.
    </p>
    <p>
        <strong>git</strong> is a tool that was designed and written by Linus Torvalds, the engineer who first
        ported the Unix kernel to the i386 personal computer platform, which has since been named "Linux." The
        <strong>git</strong> tool is designed to track and catalog changes to files. <em>Source code configuration
        management</em> is a huge part of the software engineering industry, and <strong>git</strong> is currently
        one of the primary standard tools.
    </p>
    <p>
        Imagine a typical software product with tens or hundreds of thousands of <em>Software (logical) Lines of
        Code</em> or "SLOC," sometimes referred to in kSLOC for large projects. On this project, you are one of
        25 software developers. Obviously, everyone is working on the same code, or <em>software baseline.</em> 
        If three or four engineers are are working on a bug fixes in certain parts of the code, while another 
        small team of three or four are working to implement a new feature update, at some point, common files 
        will likely be affected. This is the problem that <strong>git</strong> was built to solve. 
    </p>
    <p>
        The tool allows the developer to download a copy, or <em>clone</em> a <em>branch</em> of the code and 
        work independently without worrying about others changing their local copy. When their changes are 
        complete and tested and ready to be integrated with the baseline, the engineer makes a <em>pull request</em>
        and the owner of the main repository will carefully <em>pull</em> the changed files and compare and 
        approve all of the changes, which can then be sync-ed with the other engineers local copies. All of this
        needs to be carefully orchestrated and each project team will have its own set of policies and procedures
        to ensure that your changes do not get overwritten by another developer when they <em>commit</em> their 
        changes.
    </p>
    <p>
        Even when you are working on a team of one, it is a good practice to track the changes to your project. If
        your code is working, but incomplete, and you spend a few hours working to implement a new requirement
        and your cat knocks the fishbowl on your keyboard and before the computer turns itself off, it magically
        adds 200 keystrokes (it bounced, ok?) including the delete key so once that is all cleaned up, you do not
        even recognize the changes to your code. Ok, that is an absurd example, but what if your code worked
        yesterday and not today? After a while, you can decide to just roll back all of your changes and download
        the last known good, working copy. Does that sound familiar?
    </p>
    <p>
        The <strong>git</strong> repository allows you to do just that. The repository may be stored and accessed 
        on your local computer, but there are benefits to using a server to host the repository remotely. If the
        fishbowl rendered the computer inoperable, or if you are truly sharing with a team environment, then remote
        copies just make more sense. This is where <strong>github</strong> comes in.
    </p>
    <p>
        Just as <strong>git</strong> is a standard Configuration Management (CM) tool, <strong>github</strong> is
        one of the primary servers used to host our code. Some organizations will use other servers or even
        their own internal solutions, but many do use github to host their projects.

        This week you will set up a new github profile, or update yours if you already have one, and create a
        new repository.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
</div>
<div id="github">
    <p>
        As a developer, your github profile may become an important part of your resume.
    </p>
    <p>
        Browse to Github.com. Review the site, and the pricing model(s). As a student, you can sign up for a free
        account. I will leave it to you to discover what you need to do for that. Even with a student account, If 
        you have an email address that you expect to have for a very long time, that is the best one to use. If 
        not, that is ok. You will be able to add email accounts to your account and change them later. Select a 
        unique profile name that you can identify with, but one that you can put on your resume.

        be understood by a hiring manager.

    <ol>
        <li>
            <strong>Create an account and edit your profile.</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Add something, very brief, to your "Bio." This is just a headline, a couple of lines
                    to describe who you are or what you want to do is enough.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Update your profile picture. This is (usually) not a suit and tie picture. Save that for LinkedIn. 
                    This one gets seen by other engineers, so it can be fun, but still <em>office- and hiring 
                    manager-appropriate.</em> Do not leave it as the random pixelated random block image that 
                    is there by default.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Create a new (public) repository.</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    Click the plus sign ( + ) from the menu bar at the top and select New Repository.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Give your project a descriptive name, not <em>COP4813_project.</em> What does your web app do? 
                    Give it a name. You can change it later, or add new one and name it something else. In my
                    garage, I have a few workbenches. Two of them are always cleared off for working, but the others
                    are often cluttered with several projects. My Github (today) has 112 repositories in various
                    states of completion. Most are private, some are public. In time you may have many.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add a short description. Just a sentence or two, keep it brief.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Set the repository to <bold>Public.</bold>
                </li>
                <li>
                    Add a README file.  Check this box and click CREATE.

            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Update the README.md file.</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    You have a new repository with one file in it, called README.md. By default, every folder that 
                    open in Github, will look for a file called README.md and display it at the bottom of the screen,
                    under the list of files.
                </li>
                <li>
                    Google (yes, we are using it as a verb now) "github markdown cheat sheet." README.md is a markdown
                    file. It is a simple text file with simple formatting instructions. Use the pencil icon from the 
                    upper right corner of the README.md file to open the editor and copy/paste the description of your
                    web app project from the discussion in Canvas. This is the start to your project. You do not need
                    to start writing code yet, just create the repository and start collecting your notes here in the 
                    README file.

                    For this week, write a brief paragraph including the link to your github repository. I will follow
                    the link and look at your profile and your README file. This is your project. It can be as elaborate
                    and polished as you want it to be. Like the projects on my workbench, some are more 'finished' than
                    others, but all are in progress.
