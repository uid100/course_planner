            For this project, you will build a multi-page, data driven app like the one that’s shown below.
            Set-up the file structure. Create a new ASP.NET Core Web Application in the 4-1_ContactManager
            folder with a project folder name of ContactManager and a solution name of 4-1_ContactManager.sln.
            Base the app on the Web Application (Model-View-Controller) template. You can start your project
            with either the MVC template or the empty template. Add comments including your name, etc. to
            the top of the pages and comments throughout the pages to describe the changes/edits/updates
            that were made.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                When the app starts, it should display a list of contacts and a link to add a contact.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the user clicks the first or last name of a contact, the app should display the Detail
                page for that contact.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Details page should include buttons that allow the user to edit or delete the contact.
                Before deleting a contact, the app should display the Delete page to confirm the deletion.
            </li>
            <li>
                To reduce code duplication, the Add and Edit pages should both use the same view. This
                view should include a drop-down for Category values.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Add and Edit pages should not include the Date Added field that’s displayed by the
                Details page. That field should only be set only by code when the user first adds a contact.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the user enters invalid data on the Add or Edit page, the app should display a summary
                of validation errors above the form.
            </li>
            <li>
                Here are the requirements for valid data:
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The Firstname, Lastname, Phone, Email, and CategoryId fields are required.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Organization field is optional.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Note: Since the CategoryId field is an int (see domain model specifications
                        below), you can’t use the Required validation attribute with it. However, you
                        can use the Range attribute to make sure the value of CategoryId is greater
                        than zero.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                If the user clicks the Cancel button on the Add page, the app should display the
                Home page.
            </li>
            <li>
                If the user clicks the Cancel button on the Edit page, the app should display to the
                Details page for that contact.
            </li>
            <li>
                The domain model classes for contacts and categories should use primary keys that
                are generated by the database.
            </li>
            <li>
                The Contact class should have a foreign key field that relates it to the Category
                class. It should also have a read-only property that creates a slug of the contact’s
                first and last name that can be added to URLs to make them user friendly.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use EF Code First to create a database based on your domain model classes. Include
                seed data for the categories and one or more contacts. If the database does not run
                in Visual Studio, go to the program files on your hard drive and find the Microsoft
                SQL Server folder. Right click on the folder and select Repair. This should complete
                the process of downloading the SQL server to your computer.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use a Razor layout to store the html, head, and body elements.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use Bootstrap to style the views. If necessary, use a custom CSS style sheet to
                override Bootstrap classes.
            </li>
            <li>
                Use the default route with an additional route segment that allows an optional
                slug at the end of a URL.
            </li>
            <li>
                Make the app URLs lowercase with trailing slashes.
            <li>
                Zip the 4-1_ContactManager folder with the ContactManager folder and the
                4-1_ContactManager.sln file. Upload the zipped folder to the Module 4 Drop box
                in Canvas.
            </li>
