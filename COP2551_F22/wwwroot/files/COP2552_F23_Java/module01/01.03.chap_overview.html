    <h3>Reading</h3>
    <div id="getting_started">
        <p>Since this is an advanced programming course, it is assumed that you are becoming well-versed in learning 
        new concepts. This includes new languages as well as new tools and components. While there is no one who 
        "knows it all", many developers must rely on their power to find answers and solutions by researching. If your 
        research is not productive, then it's time to ask questions!</p>
        <p>By now, you have been through enough classes to know that the textbook is your first resource to utilize. 
        While you may not need to read every word written, it is assumed and imperative that you at least thumb through 
        the pages in order to see what is being introduced and how you will need to use the concepts presented. While 
        there is much information on the internet, be aware that some do not follow good programming principles or use
        commands that have been deprecated and will no longer function as needed.</p>
        <p>I always recommend that students begin with the table of contents. This valuable resource provides a good 
        outline of what's in each chapter. Reading this before you start your reading sets expectations and may raise
        questions or trigger thoughts and connections to watch for while you're reading the content. After you finish 
        reading a chapter or section, revisit the table of contents, or browse through the section headings to remind 
        and reinforce the content.</p>

        <h3><i>Chapter 1 Introduction to Computers and Java</i></h3>
        <h4>Chapter 1</h4>
        <p>Chapter 1 is not specifically part of the assignment and there won't be any questions asked from it. It 
        contains some background information about hardware, software and computer programming in general. According 
        to the author, this text is written for students with no prior programming background. Browse through this 
        content quickly. Most of this content will be review. If something catches your interest, read further. Do 
        you agree with the descriptions? Is it a fresh perspective?</p>
        <h5><em>Slow down through section 1.5!</em></h5>
        <p>Some of this may be new or unfamiliar. Be sure that you understand:</p>
        <ul style="margin-left: 10%;">
            Things to ask:
            <li>What is the JDK?</li>
            <li>What is the JVM</li>
            <li>What is byte code</li>
        </ul>
        <p>Take the time to write your own <em>HelloWorld.java</em> using your favorite text editor. Compile and run from the command line.</p>
        <pre>      javac HelloWorld.java 
      java HelloWorld
    </pre>
        <p>HellowWorld is <em>clich&eacute;</em>. It's a rite of passage for learning every programming language. It's simple by design, but there's something very satisfying about it. Take the time to understand each line. What are the similarities and differences to other programming languages that you've used?</p>

        <h3>Chapter 2 Java Fundamentals</h3>
        <h4>Chapter 2</h4>
        <p>Begin by reading Chapter 2. Pause at the <strong>Checkpoints</strong> and make sure you can answer the questions. When you're finished reading the chapter, it is a good idea to work through the<strong> Review Questions and Exercises</strong>. Not only will doing these things help you understand the material, but they are good preparation for the exams. The textbook is the source for the exam questions.</p>
