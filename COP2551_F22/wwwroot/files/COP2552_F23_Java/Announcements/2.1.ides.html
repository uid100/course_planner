<!-- title: "Week 2-1/2!  Source Code and IDEs"-->

<p>
    I know, week 2-1/2 isn't a real thing. The "weekly" thing was more of a guideline anyway.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Most of you know this, since it was discussed on the Discord channel too. But in case you missed it:
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) </strong>
    are an important tool to the developer.
</p>
<p>
    The IDE combines a set of tools into a single environment. Usually an editor, a compiler, a runtime 
    debugger, a profiler and others.
</p>
<p>
    Combined (integrated) into a single toolbox (environment) for creating (development) coded applications.
</p>
<p>
    Some of these are really cool. All of these are designed and intended to make the activity of writing 
    software applications easier and more streamlined. <strong>Eclipse</strong> for Java is no different. 
    It is a good tool and like any tool, the more you use it, the more familiar and the more useful it 
    will be.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    I have been told that there is a new release for Eclipse which is causing some students challenges 
    just getting it to install.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>That's ok.&nbsp;</strong> <em>(Wait, what?)</em>
</p>
<p>
    Yeah. For a couple of reasons.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <span style="text-decoration: underline;">First,</span> 
    I'm ok with letting students struggle with something on their own to figure something out. But only 
    for a little while. It is not my intent or desire to drive anyone to the point of complete frustration.
</p>
<p>
    I will admit that I haven't installed the newest Eclipse in several months. But I will. It might not 
    be for a few more days, but I'll try and get updated installation instructions to you by next week.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    And <span style="text-decoration: underline;">Second</span>, the other reason I'm not too worried about 
    the Eclipse install just yet is that, at least for the first project, you won't really need it. Java 
    source code is written in a text file. That's all. I encourage you to write your source code for this 
    first project using your favorite text editor and calling the compiler from the command line.
</p>
<pre>javac MyBrainSurgeryCheatApp.java</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    and then calling the compiled class with the java runtime
</p>
<pre>java MyBrainSurgeryCheatApp</pre>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Since the app that you are writing is probably contained in a single class, this will more clearly 
    demonstrate that the IDE is not a magic wand to create applications. It will help demonstrate just 
    what is required to make your application (class) work. And it will give you something to compare 
    with when you do have the Eclipse IDE installed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    For those of you who had no trouble installing Eclipse, great. Full speed ahead!
</p>
<p>
    For those who installed Eclipse, but the JavaFX extension isn't playing nice, that's ok too. You 
    won't need it, and should NOT use it, until one of the last labs. We'll fix it soon enough.
</p>

<p>
    As a reminder. Discord is a good place for discussions, or bring me your questions on Wednesday 
    afternoons.
