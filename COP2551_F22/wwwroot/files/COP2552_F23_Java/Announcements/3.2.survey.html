<!-- title: "Week 3++ - Survey Results - (optional read) (NEEDS UPDATE!!)"-->

<p>(Yes, three&nbsp;<em>increasingly-mislabeled</em> weekly announcements.&nbsp; This one is just conversational.&nbsp; Feel free to browse or skip it.)</p>
<p>Thank you for your responses!&nbsp; What did we find out?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>11/19 (58%)&nbsp; students responded.</p>
<p>Well, I did say it was optional. Coincidentally, that corresponds very well with average US voter turnouts, for what it's worth.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question 1 - Operating Systems</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>(7) Windows 10</li>
    <li>(3) Windows 11</li>
    <li>(1) macOS 12</li>
</ul>
<p>The only surprise here was that I set up the survey incorrectly and Canvas marked the first option as the&nbsp;<em>correct</em> answer and of course there were no <em>in</em><em>correct</em> answers.</p>
<p>An overwhelming majority of you are using Windows PCs (most of the time) by a factor of 10:1.&nbsp; Anecdotally, and without metrics, I've observed that mac users represent a much larger population in most college courses I have taught and taken, including introductory computer science and other disciplines. The single exception was a .NET course (prior to .NET5 which was supposed to target cross-platform usage) and of course, this Microsoft-sponsored and hosted curriculum was all Windows.</p>
<p>From a business perspective, Microsoft's evolution of .NET and the C# runtime environment seem to directly focus on competition with Java applications which, from their introduction, were designed specifically to be platform agnostic. This is another reason I find this particularly interesting in a Java programming course, but as a follow-up to courses in the traditionally MS-dominated world of C# and .NET, that isn't especially surprising. We use what we know.</p>
<p>The data set was small, but it may be worth mentioning that the Mac student population (of 1) is running the latest version of the operating system, but despite Microsoft releasing a significant update over 6 months ago, 70% of the Windows users are not running the latest version. There could be many reasons for this. The previous version (Win10) is still well-supported, so there isn't always a compelling reason to switch. The update includes a significant UI change, which hasn't been well received in the past (Windows 7 users held on a long time, Windows 8 was unpopular and short-lived.) Microsoft's pricing model for the update is not always clear. Windows users are often more inclined to replace hardware rather than upgrade operating systems. The relative affordability of PCs often makes complete system updates easier and more attractive. Recent versions of Windows would push system updates by default, sometimes interrupting productivity during installation. MacOS instead gently reminded users of available updates... users had to "opt-in." Windows has gotten better about asking before installing, and still doesn't 'push' major releases as a supportable path, probably because of licensing.</p>
<p>There were also several Linux releases (both RHEL and Debian variants) listed, but no respondents claimed them. It could have been the way the question was worded, or the small number of respondents,&nbsp; in an advanced CS course, I thought there may be some on board with this option.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Why did I ask?</em>&nbsp; One of my primary interests was the variations of environments you would be using and I would be supporting. As I mentioned, I do like to test on multiple platforms so that I can discover or troubleshoot differences before- or as soon as- students find them.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question 2 - Internet Reliability</strong></p>
<p>A strong majority (8) reported very reliable access. High-speed internet has become ubiquitous in most places. We take fast internet access for granted, like people having smart phones. It's not universal, but it's usually not a limitation. There were other responses, but generally if a CS student is faced with limited internet access, there is an assumption that they are very capable of finding reasonable workarounds. There weren't too many surprises here, except again, Canvas decided one answer was&nbsp;<em>correct&nbsp;</em>and tried to score it that way. Lack of internet access is becoming the rare exception.</p>
<p><em>Why did I ask?</em>&nbsp; Reliable internet access is listed as an expectation of taking this online course. I am viewing all of the responses as anonymous, so please understand that it wasn't a trap. As I mentioned, I like to travel, and sometimes I find myself in remote places, but barring situations beyond my control (they do happen), ensuring data access is a high priority.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question 3 - Shared Computer</strong></p>
<p>100% reported that they have exclusive control of the computer they use. I do have access to a few computers. There have been instances when access was more limited and I was able to create (very capable) cloud-hosted virtual machines which I was able to easily access from different (less capable and less dependable) machines. I even taught from a VM one semester. I would walk into the classroom, and using a shared computer from the podium, log in to my development machine. This meant that I could travel anywhere and have access to something I may have left unfinished earlier that day. Virtual machines, spare laptops, even Raspberry-pi single board computers can be used very creatively.</p>
<p>I have taught from college classrooms that were fully equipped with classroom and lab computers, and these are often very good options for students to use, but there are certain things that have to be considered, such as keeping your data safe and secure and available.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Why did I ask?</em> There are of course workarounds for any situation, and I'm glad to discuss creative solutions. But having confidence that students are not constrained by limited resources, removes a lot of extra concern.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question 4 - Programming Languages</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Java (18%)</li>
    <li>Python (55%)</li>
    <li>C# (91%)</li>
    <li>C++ (64%)</li>
    <li>C (9%)</li>
    <li>Javascript (36%)</li>
    <li>HTML/CSS (100%)</li>
    <li>sh... (9%)</li>
    <li>SQL (91%)</li>
</ul>
<p>Not too many surprises here. I think it tells me more about the college's pre-requisite curriculum than anything else. C#, web design, and database backgrounds. I might have expected the Javascript response to be stronger, and perhaps more shell users. If you are wondering where to go next, all on the list were good choices. I think that Typescript, Ruby and Perl should get a lot more attention than they do. Golang is another, but not as common. In my opinion, the most widely used and the most valuable asset (after this semester of course!) would be javascript. Regardless of what you are doing and working on, it is too important to ignore.</p>
<p><em>Why did I ask?</em> It's probably not enough information to have a well-informed picture, but I have an impression from the responses that most of our&nbsp;<em>collective</em> experiences are academic rather than professional. This data tells me that a few of you probably have some experience programming in the workplace, but most have taken a series of courses which led to this one. It also tells me that most of you likely are prepared with good knowledge of web architecture, protocols, and file types, in addition to basic procedural programming patterns.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong>Question 5 - Foreign Languages</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>English (100%)</li>
    <li>Spanish (36%)</li>
    <li>Vietnamese (18%)</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>(and) Question 6 - Multi-lingual</strong></p>
<ul>
    <li>Yes (18%)</li>
    <li>No (82%)</li>
</ul>
<p>I have taught at different schools in different cities with very different student groups. Recently I taught a course to active duty military personnel, many of whom had travelled to exotic destinations and I was impressed with how many languages they claimed proficiency. Two students in that class spoke more than 9 different languages. Understanding programming logic was a change in thinking, but many concepts came very easily.</p>
<p><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">The&nbsp; most recent school I have taught has more than 50% first or second generation immigrants, who speak English as a second language from many varied countries all across the globe. It is interesting to me there, that in a traditionally hispanic area, spanish was not even close to the second most popular language spoken.</span></p>
<p><em style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">Why did I ask?</em><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;"> Although the United States has no single official language, I teach exclusively in English. I wish I could confidently speak more languages, but I can't. I do love travel and have worked on many international projects. I truly enjoy meeting people from everywhere and hearing their stories, so mostly this is just my own curiosity. But, unless you are made of predominantly silicon, programming languages are, by definition, foreign languages. I think it would be interesting to see if foreign language proficiency correlates to programming logic success. It would take a lot more data than this survey though.</span></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><strong><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">Question 7 - Distance from school</span></strong><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp;</span></p>
<p><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">10/11 students are all within 25 miles of the school and one student is in the same time zone but more than 100 miles away.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">Since this is an online class, it does provide a lot of schedule flexibility, but if you can work at any time of day, why not from any place in the world?&nbsp; I did teach one class where I had students scattered in time zones from Florida, Texas, Colorado, California, Hawaii, and Okinawa!&nbsp; That class had 16 hours of classroom meetings each week, and I traveled between three different time zones between Denver, San Diego and Hilo for weeks at a time while teaching.</span></p>
<p><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">I have managed global projects with teams scattered from Australia to Dubai, Finland, Germany, UK, and all across the US. There are tools and practices to effectively manage the distance, but the time zones were sometimes the more complex problem. Especially between Northern and Southern hemisphere.</span></p>
<p><em><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">Why did I ask?</span></em><span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">&nbsp; Mostly another curiosity question, but also to infer time zones.&nbsp; For this class, I set up two distinct office hour schedules, one during the afternoon and one after typical work hours, and both arranged for Santa Fe College's local time zone.</span></p>
