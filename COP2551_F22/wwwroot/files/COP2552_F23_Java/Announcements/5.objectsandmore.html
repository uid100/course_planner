<h2>Hello again</h2>
<p>Do you ever wonder about common expressions? Why do we "catch a cold?" It seems it more likely caught me. I don't remember chasing after it. Today is Monday and a new week. I'm feeling "better," not 100% yet, but "better." I hope all of you are doing well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Week 5</h2>
<h3>I have so many questions!</h3>
<p>As we dive into week 5, and each new module for that matter, take a moment and start with the table of contents. Go back and look at the headings for each of the chapters up to this point (Chapters 1 through 5.) You've seen all of these topics before in courses leading up to this. Are any of these different in Java? Do some of the concepts make more sense now from a different perspective? &nbsp;Do you still have the textbooks you used when you learned other programming languages, C++, C#, javascript, Python, others? &nbsp;While you're considering this topical outline that is the table of contents, compare it with those other books. What do you think of this author's "early objects" approach? Does it make more sense now? Do you agree with this approach? As an advanced programming student, do you see the logic behind this learning path? Do you remember one topic that you learned that was a "lightbulb" moment, something that suddenly made something else make sense?</p>
<p>As a professional developer and software engineer, one of the lessons that may become clear to you, is that what you are learning, is not just a common language, but how to communicate and stay relevant with an evolving technology landscape. School can prepare you to start a career, but that transition is only a beginning, not an end to what you will learn. The languages, the patterns, the tools, the frameworks that we use, are all under continuous change.</p>
<p>Think about the different software packages that you use every day. How many are there? Eclipse, Windows, MS-Office, Even Instagram, Google Chrome, Google Search, and Netflix.... All of these and many more are always being worked on, updated, fixed, improved. Some of the updates are visible, some of the changes can be easily seen, interface changes for instance, bug fixes. Others may be hidden from view, but still they are being modified, tested, built, and pushed to production. When you start to realize how much software is behind everything around you and how quickly it is all changing, you begin to understand and appreciate that what you are learning when you study programming languages, is not how to make a computer say "hello world," but rather the basic building blocks for building something bigger and how that changing landscape will continue to grow and change.</p>
<h3>Chapter 6</h3>
<p>"A Second Look at Classes and Objects" The very title of the chapter begs for reviewing what was in the "first look." Since we're talking about the table of contents, keep going and take a brief walk through this chapter also. These topics may not be new to you, but it is another chance to give you a new understanding of them. While it may not be enough to just browse the headings, it probably gives you personally, an idea where you will want to spend extra time.</p>
<p>I'm a big fan of zooming in and out. When I work on a project, I remind myself to step back and review the bigger picture. What's this project look like from 10,000 feet up? That's why I encourage students to start and end with the table of contents. It's easy to get lost in the details. This is true when you are writing code or reading a chapter in a book. What is this code demo trying to show me and why is it specifically here?</p>
<p>So, that's my first piece of advice. Keep going back to the roadmap so you know where you are.</p>
<h3>Writing Code</h3>
<p>Textbooks which accompany technical topics, like programming languages, are as much references as they are end-to-end instructions. You may start from the beginning and work your way through them, but you are as likely to use them as a reference to a particular topic. The objective is to learn a skill as much as a concept. It's good to understand how and why something works, but we also need to know how to apply that technology.&nbsp;</p>
<p>The second point I want to impress on you is to practice what is in textbook. These books are meant to be opened alongside your computer. Try these things on your own. It's not enough for a football team to watch the films (tapes) of last week's game. It's good to recognize ideas and problems, but just like any foreign language, the best way to effectively learn it is to practice using it. Run all of the examples in the book. Mix things up a bit. What happens if I change this or that? Can I run this on another computer? Does it behave differently from the command line than the IDE? What else does this integrated development environment do? How does it add to my code? Are there things that the IDE is doing to make my life easier, make my code better?&nbsp;</p>
<p>Number two: practice! (A lot!)</p>
<p>It is my opinion that there are not enough graded coding exercises in this course. That doesn't mean you shouldn't be writing more.&nbsp;</p>
<p>How fast can you create an application, even "hello world" in Java? .. using the IDE? .. using a text editor and command line tools? .. what about using your other&nbsp;<em>favorite</em> language(s)? If you can't do this quickly and confidently, then practice until you can.</p>
<h3>Origins and Evolution</h3>
<p>Textbook and even online examples sometimes mention component package versions. Do you stop to ask why? If the language and the technology is evolving, maybe some pieces didn't exist in early editions. Maybe somethings won't be supported in later versions. Sometimes it's good to question not just when something in the language changed, but why did it change.</p>
<p>Many if not most textbooks that I've used start with a historical background of how a language came to be. I have often suggested that students skip over this material on first reading. But often after spending some time getting to know a new language or technology, it's a good idea to go back and revisit that. When you were first learning to write code, you probably didn't care, but maybe after a while, it might help make things clearer. Why was Java created? What else was going on at the time? Java came with it's own runtime environment. Why? Is that important?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>More Discussions</h2>
<h3>Discord</h3>
<p>Through online courses, as students and instructors, we (collectively) have tried different ways to boost discussions and conversations among people with different locations and schedules. Canvas&nbsp;<em>Discussions</em> space is actually pretty good, but generally hasn't been well received by students. #slack and (Microsoft) Teams seem to be dominant forces in the professional world for collaboration. The conduit which seems to have gained the most popular support recently is Discord, especially among online gaming enthusiasts, which not surprisingly, represent so many students in college CS departments.</p>
<p>In past courses, I've had students who stood up Discord servers and invited other to participate in timely discussions relevant to the course. &nbsp;This time, I've gone ahead and created a space with channels for this and other classes that I'm teaching. Consider this your invitation to join in and participate.</p>
<p><a href="https://discord.gg/S238T6H7" target="_blank" rel="noopener">https://discord.gg/S238T6H7</a></p>
<p>Jump in, look around and feel free to send me your thoughts and suggestions. Please treat this as an extension of the classroom and behave accordingly. Like my office hours discussions, participation is entirely optional. If it is helpful, I will add the link to the class homepage in Canvas. This is to encourage and facilitate discussions among students as much as with me. This does not replace direct email as a primary way of contacting me. Recognize also, that it is not an instant tether to me, and there still may be a lag between asking a question at odd hours and getting a response.</p>
<h3>Office Hours</h3>
<p>I mentioned last week that I may be collapsing my two scheduled office hour meeting times to one. I did get some student feedback and although I still have had no visitors, there were some student requests to keep them as they are. So for now at least, I will continue to leave the two meeting times (Wed @2P and Thu @5P) with a reminder that I may not keep the meeting open more than fifteen or twenty minutes if nobody connects.</p>
