<p>The link that I shared to join the Discord discussion had expired after 7 days. I've updated the course front page with a new link and configured it to never expire. You're all welcome to join if you haven't already.</p>

<h3><em>Practice, practice, practice...</em></h3>
<p><em>Coding is fun!</em>&nbsp; ...If you make time for it. This course has several coding projects, and a lot more coding samples to work through. The coding projects are not intended to ruin your weekend every couple of weeks. You should be working on these a little bit every day. And don't limit yourself to these. If you get stuck, work on another coding puzzle and come back to it. I mentioned codewars. It's a good place to find coding challenges to keep your problem solving skills sharp.</p>

<h3>Office hours</h3>
<p>Don't forget, I host a Zoom meeting twice each week, Wednesday and Thursday afternoons. No appointment needed and all are welcome. But I may drop off after 15 or 20 minutes if I get lonely.</p>
