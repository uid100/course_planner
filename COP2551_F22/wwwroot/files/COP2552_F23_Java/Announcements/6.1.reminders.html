<!-- title: "Week 3++ - Survey Results - (optional read) (NEEDS UPDATE!!)"-->

<p>This week, a few students discovered that although there are code examples to work through for each chapter, the graded coding projects should probably not be left to the last minute, and they might take a little bit longer than some expected. I hope that you are finding them at least interesting.</p>
<p>Coding is usually done through the process of <em>elaboration</em>. You gather and understand the requirements and get something working and gradually, little by little, add more and more capability and functionality until all of the requirements are met and all of your test cases are successful, and finally you have a chance to optimize your code and make any adjustments needed to cleanup some of the missed logic along the way and the extra diagnostic steps you might have taken.&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you have already read in my <em>late policy,&nbsp; </em>there is a built-in 24-hour <em>grace period</em> for all of the projects. Things happen. Computers crash. Appointments come up. Priorities sometimes need to be adjusted. I strongly caution anyone from viewing this as an&nbsp;<em>alternate due date,</em> but if you did procrastinate to the last weekend and then found yourself running out of time and working past midnight, or you finished it and handed it in, but you'd still like to make a couple of changes and adjustments to it, you do have until 1159PM tonight to&nbsp;<em>resubmit&nbsp;</em>if you need to.&nbsp; I won't be taking away points and I'll only consider the last submission, so it is an option.</p>
<p><strong>CodeWars</strong> In addition to the coding examples, I like to use <a class="inline_disabled" href="http://codewars.com" target="_blank" rel="noopener">codewars.com</a> for some short added coding challenges. There are others of course, but I'm used to this one. The challenges are short and they include unit test code which is always a good idea anyway. I also like completing short challenges when I'm shifting between coding tools, Visual Studio, NetBeans, Eclipse, VSCode... each one [IDE] handles keyboard shortcuts a little differently and each one has it's own configuration and predictive typing styles to get used to. One of the things I like best about CodeWars is that after I've spent 5 minutes or 35 minutes working through an exercise and making my best effort (and passing all of the built-in testing, of course,) next I get the opportunity to see other solutions to the same problem and other ideas which I might not have considered.&nbsp;</p>
<p>Check it out and let me know what you think.</p>
