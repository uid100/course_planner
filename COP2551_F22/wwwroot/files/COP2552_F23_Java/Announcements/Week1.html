<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    You are enrolled in&nbsp;COP2552 - Object Oriented Programming 2 and should have access to the
    course materials through Canvas (through the link on sfcollege.edu.)&nbsp;
</p>

<p>
    I'm Dan. This is me. Ok, this was me about ten years ago. My hair's grayer, eyesight worse,
    clothes are tighter, but my beautiful wife likes this picture.&nbsp;
</p>
<p>
    If you've had one of my classes before, some of this will look familiar. I do reuse material 
    when I can, but hopefully it will still be relevant. As always, if you find any errors, missing 
    images, or broken links in the course, please let me know!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    This is a 15-week course in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using Java. We have a lot of 
    material to cover but it is designed to build on the knowledge and experience you already 
    have. Much of the course will be reinforcing common patterns and strategies, some will be new, 
    and as with every new language, the way to succeed and even <strong><em>enjoy</em></strong>
    the experience is to immerse yourself in it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Of course, full-immersion suggests that you're either waiting around for access to your 
    trust fund, or lottery winnings, or you just sold your first company to Jeff Bezos, and 
    you have nothing else to do. (<em>Anyone? No?</em>)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Ok, for the rest of us, if you can trust the word of a complete stranger (<em>a friend 
    you haven't met yet,</em>) I can promise you that the more time that you are able 
    to commit to this pursuit, the more <strong>enjoyment</strong> you'll get in return. I 
    know. I used that word again! The truth is, I do <strong>enjoy</strong> programming. 
    I think a lot of us do. If you don't, consider finding something else to do, because 
    career programming only gets more demanding. Programming is a blend of science and art. 
    And the more challenging something is, the greater the sense of satisfaction when you 
    achieve it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    I know that, in reality, most of us have family and jobs and bills and other priorities.
    <em>Hey, the sun is shining, there's a building south swell, and my friends are all 
    headed to the beach with a case of <strong>my</strong> favorite beverage on ice!</em> 
    Ok, or more likely, <em>the lawn needs to be mowed, the kids have soccer practice, the 
    roof is leaking, and it's the busy season, so overtime at work is no longer optional</em>. 
    I know that life is about balancing priorities, and this course is probably not at the 
    top of that list. If you want to succeed in this class, I can promise you that it will 
    require a time commitment.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what can you expect?</p>
<p>
    There are 15 weeks in the term. We're going to walk through one of Tony Gaddis' 
    <em>Starting out with...</em> textbooks.

    If you don't already have it, find it quick. If you got a great deal on an older edition, 
    you may be ok for at least a few weeks. We're going to be using the Eclipse IDE for Java. 
    I have a current release, and will be installing any updates this weekend. We're not 
    working on legacy code, so there's no reason not to use the latest and find any sticking 
    points as we go along. (<em>Real-world stuff!</em>). We'll spend a few weeks migrating 
    knowledge of object-oriented programming and familiar procedural design patterns to a 
    different syntax and some new rules. We'll be learning some new libraries and approaches 
    to graphical user interfaces (GUIs). Mostly, we'll be writing a lot of code. There are 
    (online) exams every couple of weeks, and some projects to apply what you are reading 
    about and practicing with sample code.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Speaking of <em>online,</em> the college lists this as a <em>web</em> course. You'll 
    also hear it referred to as <em>asynchronous.</em> We won't have scheduled meetings, but 
    we do have a class schedule to accomplish. The Canvas course is designed to guide you 
    through, but we'll do it together, and I will make an effort to not let you feel alone 
    through the process.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What to do next?</p>
<p>
    Find the course from your Canvas dashboard linked from the college website. Read through 
    the front page material and take a look at the links that are there. I've tried to set it 
    up so that all of the logical navigation links that you'll want are there.
</p>
<p>
    You can find out more about me, about the course, read the syllabus (there's a lot there) 
    and then go to the first module and start reading the first 2 chapters of the book.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    I have scheduled times during the week when you can easily find me online. Please note 
    that I travel often, but all of the times listed in the course are local time at Santa 
    Fe College (EST).
