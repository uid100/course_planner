<!-- title: "Week 3+ - Grading Questions and Peer Review"-->


<h2>Another Announcement?</h2>
<p>Two in one week? It happens. My&nbsp;<em>approximately&nbsp;</em>weekly announcements may change frequency. If we were in class, you'd be spending hours each week listening to me and hanging on my every word, so asking you to read a little extra shouldn't come as a burden. But if you prefer, you can scroll quickly to the bottom and just catch the wrap-up.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Communications</h3>
<p>In my undergraduate experience, it was not uncommon to walk down the halls of an academic building, or through an adjacent garden and meet and greet department faculty and staff, exchange greetings and have an opportunity to ask questions. The upside was that, if your schedules coincided, faculty were accessible, on the other hand, those <em>chance</em> meetings usually weren't all that productive and when you did meet, the individuals may have been rushing to a meeting or engaged in conversation with someone else. Office hours were usually the better option, but even then, adjusting your schedule, driving to campus, finding parking... really didn't happen very often.</p>
<p>In some ways, my experience with&nbsp;<em>virtual</em> office hours have been even more productive. Sometimes it's just a quiet time when I can catch up on grading and email, but sometimes these are well attended (webcams help!) and have led to student-led discussions and questions about a current project or relevant material. I have some students that regularly attend office hours, not because they have questions, but just to listen and learn from others' questions. Or, it could be because of my striking good looks and irresistible personality. Yeah, my wife and kids don't think so either.</p>
<p>So perhaps email is the best solution. But email&nbsp;<span style="color: var(--ic-brand-font-color-dark); font-family: inherit; font-size: 1rem;">can go either way. I'm sure we can all recall examples of written correspondence (text messages?) that somehow changed meaning between sender and receiver. So much can be lost or misconstrued if we aren't very careful with not only what we write, but how we write it. Anyone who is sensitive or <em>not-</em>sensitive, or generally sarcastic, or has an appreciation for very dry-humor, add to that- cultural differences which can lead to unexpected misunderstandings and you, we (, all of us!) are especially at risk.</span></p>
<p>All of that to say, I have been impressed and encouraged by the several emails I have received from your class with thoughtful and well-articulated questions and concerns. I do try to reply to email as soon as I can, and I prioritize student email, but many of these discussions I want to share with others in the class as well. This week, I've had a few students raise questions and concerns about the grading rubric, specifically for <strong>project 1</strong>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Grading Rubric(s)</h3>
<p>I own the curriculum, and it is my responsibility, so please don't misunderstand my general disclaimer, but much of the curriculum in the course was inherited- not created by me and this includes the rubric. I mention this, not to distance myself from it, but to explain my level of familiarity with it. In other words, in this case, it's new to me too. I'm delighted that students are reading it, since it does provide project guidance and insight into project requirements. In the professional world, you as engineers, would continuously measure against the requirements, with (hopefully) open discussions with key stakeholders. In those <em>real-world</em> situations, requirements are not left to interpretation, but they are also not static and they&nbsp;<em>must</em> be available for mutual agreed change(s) to stay relevant.&nbsp;</p>
<p>So that's the general background. To answer your questions much more specifically and directly, <strong>yes,</strong> I will use the rubric as a checklist to step through your project and ensure that requirements are met.&nbsp;<strong>yes</strong>, I agree with your concerns that the grading criteria is probably more detailed and restrictive than it needs to be. After all,&nbsp;<em>coding is fun!</em>&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type: none;">
        <ul>
            <li><em>So how do we get back to that&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline;">fun</span> part (yeah, I said it!) and away from the worry and concern? &nbsp;</em></li>
            <li><em>How do I write my assignment to meet your seemingly&nbsp;very rigid guidelines. And most importantly,</em></li>
            <li><em>What are you&nbsp;really going to be looking for when you grade my assignment?</em></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>I'm glad you asked.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Code Review</h3>
<p>An essential part of any engineering effort, is peer review. This activity occurs continuously throughout the project life cycle, in addition to very specific intervals. It affects all engineering artifacts including requirements and design documents, code, and even test procedures. Not only is peer review its own specialty with its own documented process, it is deeply ingrained in all phases of business and engineering. In most professional environments, nothing will pass from one phases to another, or be released internally or externally, without formal or informal peer review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><em>What Code?</em></h4>
<p>As a new developer on the engineering team, you are most likely to be given a block of working,&nbsp;<em>legacy</em> code and a <strong>problem report</strong>. This assignment may take on different names from organization to organization, but they are roughly the same. There is an error, or a discrepancy, or performance issue, or new feature request in the system that we are already using, and your first task is to locate it. Notice that the&nbsp;<em>new guy</em> is usually not asked to meet with a customer and design a new solution from the ground up. We're going to bring you up to speed first. Back at your desk, you familiarize yourself with how the system works, try out all of the inputs and try to simulate the same conditions as the problem report and see if the error occurs as described. You may be asked to further refine the description.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><em>Change Process</em></h4>
<p>Once you've duplicated the error, you may be given your own separate copy (branch) of the source code to read and follow and step through to identify why the application is responding the way it does, where the values are occurring and make a suggestion about how to change the code to prevent or change the behavior. This results in a&nbsp;<strong>change request</strong>. Next, the change request will be validated by a senior engineer, resources allocated, and someone, maybe you, will be approved to implement the change. After the code is changed, it will be code reviewed and integrated with the rest of the system, still on that separate branch, and tested thoroughly. Once the change has been tested, then it will be merged with the production branch, tested once more and released.</p>
<p>This is an even more detailed process than what I've described, but the important message is that no code should ever be written or accepted without code review.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h4><em>Code Review</em></h4>
<p>If all of the code that you write, as well as others is reviewed first, who is doing that review? The answer is "everyone."</p>
<p>Code reviews are not personal. As often as a programmer's code is being reviewed, he or she are just as likely being asked to review other's code.</p>
<p>The code needs to be up to the quality standards of the company's products. The reputation of the engineers, the products, and the company depends on it.</p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type: none;">
        <ul>
            <li>Engineers are not being reviewed, their product is.</li>
            <li>Engineers are not being reviewed, their product is.</li>
            <li>Engineers are not being reviewed, their product is.</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>If you're the new guy with no experience, or the seasoned professional with many years' experience, that code must be correct, of good quality, and maintainable in order to be acceptable. As an engineer in the organization, you must not care who wrote the code, only that it is the best your company can produce.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>So if everything I write is reviewed, does that mean I should have thick skin, and be prepared to get beat up by regular evaluation, scrutiny, and</em> ridicule? Of course not. Peer review is a good thing. It's an opportunity to learn from others, to help each other develop a better product.</p>
<p>Sometimes new developers are surprised to learn that they are asked to review more experienced developers' code. You may learn as much from looking at code as having others look at yours.&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>But what are you (we) looking for?</em></p>
<p>The code is checked to see that:</p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type: none;">
        <ul>
            <li>the requirements are met,</li>
            <li>the syntax is correct,</li>
            <li>the logic is correct,</li>
            <li>the identifiers (variable, constant, and method names) are descriptive and meaningful and consistent with coding standards,</li>
            <li>that use of whitespace is reasonable for readability and consistent.</li>
            <li>There are no unnamed or unexplained constants (numeric or string literals)</li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This list is approximate off the top of my head. In most professional environments, the code reviewer would have a formal checklist and the formal coding standards, but this is what you will look for.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Or put even more simply:</p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type: none;">
        <ul>
            <li><span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">Does it work?</span></li>
            <li><span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">Does it do what it&rsquo;s supposed to do?</span></li>
            <li><span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">Is it easy to understand? </span>(and)</li>
            <li><span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">How could we make it better?</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>In that professional environment, the result of the peer review (or code review) is a list of findings. Each finding will then be reviewed (sometimes by committee) and either:</p>
<ul>
    <li><strong> implemented</strong> (that's correct, let's fix that)</li>
    <li><strong>deferred</strong> (that's a good idea, but it's not part of the requirement for this assignment and we don't have time or budget right now)</li>
    <li>or <strong>rejected</strong> (it might be incorrect because the reviewer didn't have all of the information, or may be inconsistent with another requirement)</li>
</ul>
<p>The findings are each closed and the cycle continues.</p>
<p>As part of a college computer class, the natural assumption is that the student is being assessed, but really it's the same process. The instructor is looking at the submitted assignment, not the student. It is my goal to learn with you and help you to become better engineers. Prior to this class, you already have learned programming. You've already successfully written applications in other programming languages. I would like you to be better programmers from the experience of programming. I can help by looking at your code and providing feedback. So,&nbsp;</p>
<ul>
    <li style="list-style-type: none;">
        <ul>
            <li><span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">Does it work?</span></li>
            <li><span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">Does it do what it&rsquo;s supposed to do?</span></li>
            <li><span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">Is it easy to understand? </span>(and)</li>
            <li><span style="background-color: #f1c40f;">How could we make it better?</span></li>
        </ul>
    </li>
</ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A common task in technical interviews is to walk through a so-called <em>white-boarding</em> exercise. The candidate is given a problem or set of requirements and then drafts a solution with either code or pseudo-code, checks the solution, and then (importantly) optimizes the solution. How could you make it better?</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Dan, &nbsp;TLDR!!!&nbsp;</em>(<em>Google</em> it)</p>
<p>Yeah, I know. All of that is interesting but what do I do with my project and what will you be looking for?</p>
<p>Try new things. Meet the requirements. Test your code and make sure it works. Follow good programming standards (unnamed constants in code are a pet-peeve.,) and then make another pass to look for ways to optimize your code. If you can check all the boxes in the Rubric, great. Is your code&nbsp;<em>self-documenting</em>? Is it readable? Are the identifiers meaningful and descriptive?&nbsp;<em>How could you make it better, clearer, more reusable, and/or more efficient?</em></p>
