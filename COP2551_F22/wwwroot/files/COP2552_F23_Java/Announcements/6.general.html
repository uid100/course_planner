<p>Week 6 already!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><em>Aloha mai kākou</em>! (Greetings and blessings to all!) It is week 6 already!</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>As you know, I host an open meeting for this class on Wednesday afternoons. These seem to be productive. Stop by for a short visit, or get involved in a conversation about the class or your project.&nbsp;<br /><br />I'm also getting good questions in my inbox. I don't always get a chance to see these on weekends, but I do read and reply to them. There has been a lot of good participation on Discord too. I'll take some of your technical questions and answer them there, since if you have the question, someone else probably has as well. I hope that's been helpful. I'm happy to see that I'm not the only one posting there now.</p>
<p>This is an advanced OOP class. Remember to use <em>objects</em> in your solutions. Start by asking what the entities are.&nbsp;</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Project 3 is an activity or exercise tracker. What are the objects?&nbsp;</p>
<p>My solution has a menu object and exercise objects. You want to run? I create a run object and add it to a list. Weight lifting? create the object, add it to a list. Dance? Play Tennis? Go Bowling? Crete a "Dance" "Tennis" and "Bowling" object.&nbsp; When the user requests a summary, simply iterate through the list and use the ToString() method from each created object.&nbsp; You want to create 17 new exercises? simple. They all track almost the same thing, so they all inherit from the Exercise class.&nbsp;<br /><br />Remember the DRY (do not repeat yourself) principle.&nbsp; If you have 3 exercises that all do almost the same thing, then move those lines of code to the base class and only keep the distinctions in the derived classes.</p>

<p>Like Project 2, don't try to do this one in a day.</p>
