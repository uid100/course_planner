    <h2>"Web" Distance-learning</h2>
    <p>
        By now, most of us have experienced online courses and you're probably wondering how this one is
        going to work.
    </p>
    <p>
        Like most of the courses you've probably experienced at this school, our course material will be
        contained here within the Canvas online system, and accessed through the school's website.
    </p>

    <h3>Important reminders:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li><em>remote</em>, or <em>distance-learning</em> does not mean independent learning, and</li>
        <li>online does not mean <em>self-paced</em></li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h4><em>"We are not alone."</em></h4>
    <p>
        This course is what's known as an <em>asynchronous</em> course. That means that we will not have
        scheduled meetings, either online or face-to-face. people take online courses for a variety of
        reasons. Traditionally, the primary factor was schedule flexibility, to work around work or family
        schedules. More recently of course a global health crisis changed the way people live and work.
        Working and going to school remotely didn't begin with the pandemic, but it certainly became more
        common and more accepted.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>
        There are benefits to being online from whatever location works best for you, but there are also
        down-sides. When studying a technical subject, there may be times of frustration when things just
        aren't making sense, and in spite of what I'm telling you, you'll look around your workspace and
        feel very alone. You are not. There is a Canvas discussion board to ask (and answer!) questions
        to and from other students.
    </p>
    <p>
        The format of my online office hours is intended to be for open technical discussion. Because of
        this, I generally separate meeting times for different classes, although I may be available at
        other times as well. Check the syllabus for the times arranged for this class, and send me an
        email if you'd like to request another time, or have a question that is more appropriate for a
        one-on-one discussion.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>All times listed are local in Gainesville, FL.</em> It is my sincere hope that these times
        will fit with your schedule.
    </p>
    <p>
        Office hours are hosted in Zoom. These are completely optional, and not planned, or structured
        lessons or lectures. These are open sessions and students are invited to connect and bring your
        questions and issues with the projects that you have. Students will guide the discussion and I
        will be available to provide answers and explanations. Students are encouraged to answer each
        other's questions also. Be aware, due to the open nature of these meetings, if you have a question
        of a more individual or personal nature, I will work with you to schedule an alternate meeting
        time.
    </p>
    <p>
        Please note, these are scheduled one hour blocks, but as long as I have no schedule conflict,
        these discussions may frequently go on longer. On the other hand, on those occasions that noone
        connects to the meeting, I may close the meeting after waiting for 20-30 minutes.
    </p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <h4><em>Not self-paced</em></h4>
    <p>
        The school has scheduled a block of time and resources for each class to complete a set of
        learning objectives. It should be no surprise that there are many factors considered in that
        scheduling. Likewise, each course is divided into smaller pieces of achievable blocks of learning
        and, like in our case, these build on each other.
    </p>
    <p>
        By keeping up with the schedule as designed, there is time to complete the assignments, and I
        have time to grade them and get feedback to you for next time.
