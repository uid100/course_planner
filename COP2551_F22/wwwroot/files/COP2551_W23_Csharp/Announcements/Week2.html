    I've gotten a couple of email messages from students about project 1.
    From what I've heard, it sounds like people are enjoying coding in Visual C#.

    I'm seeing more and more participation on the Discord server too. That's 
    encouraging. Look there to participate in the discussion and get some tips on 
    the projects too!

    I know that at least a couple of people had to reinstall Visual Studio. If 
    you have used Visual Studio before, try running the installer and check that 
    the correct project "loads" are installed. There is a Canvas page in Module 0 
    to help with installing Visual Studio 2022. You'll want to be certain to install 
    .NET Framework for Windows form programming. The textbook is specific to 
    WinForms development.

    Don't forget to come visit us on Discord and say 'Hello!'
