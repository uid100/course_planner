<h2><em>Part 2?</em></h2>

<p><em>Part 2 of a "Weekly announcement?"</em></p>

<p>
    Yeah. That "Weekly" thing is more of a guideline. I know that you already have a lot to read
    and here I am sending you more. On the other hand, if we were in class together, then you'd
    be a captive audience for a few hours, so I really think sending you a few thoughts from time
    to time is justified.
</p>
<p>
    And while I'm thinking about it, I want to remind you that the Discord server (info on the home
    page) is getting more participation. Drop in and say 'hello.' It's good reminder that you're
    really not going through this alone.

<h3><em>Can I use my Mac?</em></h3>
<p>
    This course follows the textbook and the examples and the exercises require following a very
    narrow set of requirements including using .NET Framework (3.1) and Windows Forms Applications.
    There is some cross platform support in .NET Core for other platforms, but Visual C# and this
    course, will require access to a Windows PC. I will be using the latest release of Visual Studio
    (2022) but targetting .NET Framework for Windows Forms applications, not .NET Core and these
    are not compatible with the MacOS.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><em>But I love my Mac!</em></h3>
<p>
    Me too. In fact, I have have several computers in my office and I frequently test in multiple
    physical and virtual environments. I share monitors, mouse and trackpad between them on my
    workstation, but I do have multiple keyboards that I switch between because the keyboards are
    more different than most people realize.
</p>
<p>
    There are Windows PCs available in the new lab on campus. I've also had some success using
    virtual machines, but unless you are already configured for this, it can get expensive pretty
    quickly. Short answer, you will need a Windows PC to do the work required in this class. There
    is more information pinned on the resources channel on my Discord server.

(from Fall: Nov-2022)
<h2>C# 10.0 (today)</h2>
<p>UPDATE:<br />
    I've been a professional developer for many (many) years. There are few programming languages
    that I <em>don't</em> like, but some make me happier than others. C# is one of those! I have
    used and taught C# for a long time and have watched the language evolution closely, although
    (<em>queue the sound of squealing brakes</em>) I haven't yet taught this at Santa Fe College.
    So I'm working through the course materials that <em>we</em> have inherited and making notes
    and minor adjustments along the way.
</p>
<p>
    UPDATED: It's Spring now, so I've been through the material at least once. There will still
    be adjustments. If you find something that doesn't look right, let me know!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    I've used and reviewed different textbooks along the way including several of Mr. Gaddis'
    titles, but this is my first time with this particular book. One thing that you've probably
    already recognized is that the textbook references an older release of the development tools,
    and some of the screen images may not match. This is quite common. It's a reminder that we
    are working on an emerging technology. There is a technical steering group at the dotnet
    foundation, made up of Microsoft engineers and others that evaluate changes. They have
    committed to releasing language updates every year according to the current plan, and
    significant changes are included with each new release of the language. The tools are
    evolving to keep up.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Many times, you may have a technical question or challenge that requires some research.
    Sometimes you'll find the answer is from compatibility issues, but sometimes the
    <em>answers</em> that you find also may not be current. <strong>StackOverflow</strong>,
    for instance is a great resource bringing together a community of developers to work
    through common and not-so-common questions. Helping others is a great way to strengthen
    your own knowledge of a subject. When you find these answers, consider the reputation
    of the source, someone who doesn't contribute often doesn't necessarily mean they are
    not qualified, but someone with more "upvotes" might be a better source. Also, pay
    attention to when the suggestion was written since it may not apply after some amount
    of time has passed.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Then what's the point?</h3>
<p>
    With that said, the language is very stable and well-designed. We will be learning best
    practices and common patterns, frameworks and syntax. We're also learning to be flexible
    and recognize analysis and troubleshooting paths to solving problems. When I was
    supervising teams of engineers or working face-to-face with individual students, people
    would sometimes tell me that I get oddly excited when someone brings a coding problem to
    me. That's what this career field is about. We don't sit around writing
    <em>HelloWorld</em> apps, or practicing integer sort algorithms. Sometimes we're designing
    new solutions or integrating existing code, but more often, we're troubleshooting and
    uncovering problems and looking for new approaches to old problems.
</p>
<p>
    I remember working on large scale projects when major product releases were being
    distributed and insisting that none of the engineering teams changed versions of any of
    the tools and libraries we were using at the time, until after we delivered the product.
    In some cases, there might have been no impact, but there was always a risk, so we chose
    to avoid it.
</p>
<p>
    But the start of a new project or class is the perfect time to embrace the latest and
    greatest technologies and tools.
</p>
<p>
    I've been stepping through the example code in the book on my updated installation of
    Visual Studio 2022. Yes, the screens are different, but I've confirmed that the code
    works without changes. The book directs building the examples using .NET Framework.
    That is still supported (in Visual Studio 2022) but I have also tested some (not all)
    of the solutions in the newer .NET Core templates and I've been impressed that what I've
    used so far works very well on that platform also. It's worth mentioning that I haven't
    been successful using Visual Studio for Mac with these yet, but I know that Microsoft's
    support for that platform has always been a little behind, so I'll probably shelve that
    effort for a while.
</p>
<h2>Basics</h2>
<p><em>What's important?</em></p>
<p>
    I know that module 1 (weeks 1 and 2) are steering you to chapters 2 and 3. Don't
    completely skip Chapter 1. Most of Chapter 1 will be unnecessary review, but it may still
    have some good information that is worth your time to at least browse.
</p>
<p>
    Chapter 2 steps through the step-by-step essentials of writing Windows Forms (WinForms)
    GUI applications and how to get the most from the IDE. Even though at least 2 major
    releases of Visual Studio have cycled since the pages were written, the information is
    still correct and still applies. The properties window, accessing the code behind the
    <em>Design,</em> that's all important to understand. Practice these.
</p>
<p>
    Chapter 3 discusses GUI elements and component and data types. Most of this will be
    review- and then I came to section 3.8 Using Named Constants!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Named Constants</h3>
<p>
    This is a pet peeve and one of the things that separates experienced developers from
    beginners. If you've already read through this section, go back and read it again. It's
    a simple section that 's easy to overlook. One of the problems is that if you overlook
    this section, your code will still work. It won't be good code, but it will work.
</p>
<p>
    My advice, look through your code. If you have numbers in your code, do they belong?
    If it's a constant, it should be set to a name and documented with a comment what the
    source is. Hint: most of the time it might say something like:
</p>
<pre>
double KM_PER_MILE = 0.62;&nbsp; &nbsp;// per customer requirement dated: 15-Jun-2021<br />
double localTaxRate = .625;&nbsp; // based on Whoville, Jan 2010
</pre>
<p>
    Named constants are usually defined together near the top of your code and reused
    throughout, so that they can be reviewed and updated (if necessary) in one place.
</p>
<p>Look for numbers in your code.</p>
<p>
    Named constants don't need to be numeric. "String literals" also are usually better set
    to named constants if there is a chance they will be used again. As you build more
    advanced code, some of these simple strings might need to be replaced by another language
    depending on user settings. It's better to do this in one place then to be searching
    through hundreds or thousands of lines of code for where they might occur.
</p>
<p>
    I'll let that go for now. I think it struck me most because I'm also teaching a beginning
    programming course and I see this every day. I&nbsp; don't expect to see it as much from
    more advanced students.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Scope</h3>
<p>
    I'll mention this because the next section talks about class fields and also mentions
    <em>static</em> classes and elements. Unfortunately, these are discussed without an
    explanation of classes and objects, so for now, I'll just mention that there could be
    more to this discussion of "class fields" than we are going to discuss now, so that when
    we do go deeper later, it will at least look familiar.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Practice, practice, practice</h3>
<p>
    That's really the theme, not just for these chapters, but for the course. The more time
    you spend in the language and making things work, the more you'll get out of the language
    and the more comfortable it will be.
</p>
<p>
    Yes, there are two weeks reserved for this module. Please don't wait to get started.
