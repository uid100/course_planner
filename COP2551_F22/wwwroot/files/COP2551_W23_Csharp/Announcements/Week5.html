<h3>Catching up</h3>
<p>
    I've heard from several of you that are having fun writing code. That makes me happy. 
    I've had the chance to write a lot of code lately too, in several different languages(!) 
    which is always a challenge, but still a lot of fun.

<h3>Discord</h3>
<p>
    This class has the most active discussions on Discord. So many really good questions 
    getting asked, answered, and discussed. If you haven't had a chance to jump on the 
    server yet, Consider this another invitation and nudge to get you over there. Look 
    around. Let me know what you think!
</p>

<h3>Modular Code</h3>
<p>
    Speaking of writing code, this isn't your first time around the block writing code in 
    some language, so things like methods are not new to you, although in some languages 
    you might have used 'functions' or 'procedures' or 'subroutines'.&nbsp; For our purposes, 
    assume that we're talking about the same thing. Your code should be modular. Methods 
    should do one thing and be able to be tested independently. You will hear again and 
    again, that your code needs to be <em>highly cohesive </em>and <em>loosely coupled.</em> 
    That means that the pieces should do what they need to do and nothing else, and not rely 
    on other things outside of themselves. When you change something, somewhere in your code, 
    it shouldn't break something, some place else in your code! That's what it means. If you're 
    going to be interviewing for a programming job, write that down. "Highly cohesive and 
    Loosely coupled." Google it. Then Google it again in a couple of months to see if it means 
    the same thing to you. It's that important!
</p>

<h3>Common Structures</h3>
<p>
    Like you saw in Python or C++ or Visual Basic or Java or javascript or Ruby on Rails or 
    any number of other programming languages where you've played, you see common building 
    blocks. Conditional statements (If-ElseIf-Else, Switch-Case) and loop structures (While, 
    For, Do-While). These are pervasive. These basic logic statements are everywhere, and not 
    just in coding. You manage these every time you decide what clothes to put on, or when to 
    apply the brakes in your car, or which brand of cereal to buy at the store. Sometimes the 
    decisions are quick and you may not even realize how many logic conditions you are stepping 
    through. In programming, these are explicit. The more code that you write, the more you 
    will start to recognize these "system logic" threads that are everywhere.
</p>
<p>
    Windows Forms coding gives us a different medium than console programming, but as you have 
    seen, the code and the structures are still there. The tool is powerful in what it can do 
    for you, and all of the details that it shields you from, but take the time to dive deeper.
    Find the changes the tools are making and justify them to yourself. Make changes manually 
    to see what they do. And test, test, test!
</p>

<h3>Text Processing</h3>
<p>
    Next week we'll be looking at chapter 8. Text processing is very important, maybe more when 
    using Windows Form applications, since all of the input and output boxes contain text as 
    their native data types and not boolean or floating point or integer. When a user enters 
    something in a text box, you need to be able to accept that, validate it, parse it, and 
    manipulate it in different ways before processing for output or writing to a database.
</p>
<p>
    There is a new project next week, you'll be taking free-form text such as words and 
    sentences, and creating camelCase and PascalCase strings from it. Pascal case is a 
    specialized variant of camelCase. If you are not sure about the difference, I'll leave 
    it to you to find the answer.

    Keep coding. Come visit us on Discord. I hope you're having as much fun as I am.
