<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>You are enrolled in <strong>COP 2551 Intermediate Object-Oriented Programming</strong>, and should have access to the course materials through Canvas (through the link on sfcollege.edu.)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>I'm Dan. This is me. Ok, this was me about ten years ago. My hair's grayer, eyesight worse, clothes are tighter, but my beautiful wife likes this picture.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>This is a 15-week course in Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) using C#. &nbsp;We have a lot of material to cover but it is designed to build on the knowledge and experience you already have. We will start with some assumptions, that you are comfortable with your computer environment and the terminology and are not brand new to programming, but there will be new topics as well. We will be reinforcing common patterns and strategies, some will be new, and as with every new language, the way to succeed and even <strong><em>enjoy</em></strong> the experience is to immerse yourself in it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Of course, full-immersion suggests that you're either waiting around for access to your trust fund, or lottery winnings, or you just sold your first company to Jeff Bezos, and you have nothing else to do. &nbsp;(<em>Anyone? No?</em>)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ok, for the rest of us, if you can trust the word of a complete stranger (<em>a friend you haven't met yet,</em>) I can promise&nbsp;you that the more time that you are able to commit to this pursuit, the more <strong>enjoyment</strong> you'll get in return. I know. I used that term again! The truth is, I do&nbsp;<strong>enjoy</strong> programming. I think a lot of us do. If you don't, consider finding something else to do, because career programming only gets more demanding. Programming is a blend of science and art. And the more challenging something is, the greater the sense of satisfaction when you achieve it.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that, in reality, most of us have family and jobs and bills and other priorities.&nbsp;</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>Hey, the sun is shining, there's a building south swell, and my friends are all headed to the beach with a case of&nbsp;<strong>my</strong> favorite beverage on ice!</em></p>
<p>Ok, or more likely,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;"><em>the lawn needs to be mowed, the kids have soccer practice, the roof is leaking, and it's the busy season, so overtime at work is no longer optional</em>.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I know that life is about balancing priorities, and this course is probably not at the top of that list. If you want to succeed in this class, I can promise you that it will require a time commitment.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what can you expect?</p>
<p>There are 15 weeks in the term. We're going to walk through one of Tony Gaddis' <em>Starting out with...</em> textbooks.</p>
<p><img id="43798868" style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://courses.sfcollege.edu/users/1450061/files/43798868/preview?verifier=WVCFYWaeM8ECKujEmxxCCmE42s3nJKpd4Fyzj0sy" alt="Starting out with C# Textbook Cover" width="164" height="210" data-api-endpoint="https://courses.sfcollege.edu/api/v1/users/1450061/files/43798868" data-api-returntype="File" /></p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>If you don't already have it, find it quick. If you got a great deal on an older edition, you may be ok for at least a few weeks. We're going to be using Microsoft Visual Studio. The current release is '2022.' The Community Edition is a free download. It will take some time and not an insignificant amount of storage space on your computer, but it is the industry standard and you will need this to be successful.&nbsp; I have a current release, and will be installing any updates this weekend. We're not working on legacy code, so there's no reason not to use the latest and find any sticking points as we go along. (<em>Real-world stuff!</em>).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Our textbook will reference different versions of the tool, and we may encounter some differences and even some challenges along the way, but that really is what we sometimes face as code developers. When you find these things, let us know and we'll work through them together. (Discord is great for that!)</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Mostly, we'll be writing a lot of code. Set aside some time. Write out the examples in the book as you are reading. The time will be well spent. Related to that, some of the sample code is available as a download from the publisher. In general, I firmly believe that you'll get more out of typing the examples yourself than you ever will simply reviewing pre-written code. You won't learn to play the guitar by listening alone, you need to have your fingers on the strings. In much the same way, there are keyboard shortcuts that you pick up along the way, but experience requires trying things and making mistakes.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>There are (online) exams every couple of weeks, and some projects to apply what you are reading about and practicing with sample code.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Speaking of&nbsp;<em>online,&nbsp;</em>the college lists this as a&nbsp;<em>web</em> course. You'll also hear it referred to as&nbsp;<em>asynchronous.</em> We won't have scheduled meetings, but we do have a class schedule to accomplish. The Canvas course is designed to guide you through, but we'll do it together, and I will make an effort to not let you feel&nbsp;alone through the process.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What to do next?</p>
<p>Find the course from your Canvas dashboard linked from the college website. Read through the front page material and take a look at the links that are there. I've tried to set it up so that all of the logical navigation links that you'll want are there. You can find out more about me, about the course, read the syllabus (there's a lot there) and then go to the first module and start reading the first three (3) chapters of the book.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Browse through the first chapter. Most of it will be review. If anything catches your interest, spend a few minutes reading about that, but you are welcome to simply browse through this material and maybe come back to it some other time. In Chapters 2 and 3, you'll get to write some code. I highly recommend that you start and end your reading sessions with the table of contents. Use this outline to find out what's in the chapter, and then as a quick review to remind yourself what you have read. The publisher's PowerPoint slides for the chapter are also in the module for this purpose as well.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have scheduled times during the week when you can easily find me online. Please note that I travel often, but all of the times listed in the course are local time at Santa Fe College (EST).&nbsp;</p>
