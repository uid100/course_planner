<h2>Week 3 - TicketSales project feedback</h2>

<div id="general-feedback" style="padding:20px;">
    <h3 class="alert alert-info">General Feedback</h3>
    <p>
        I was very pleased with the TicketSales pricing calculator that you created.
        I usually try and include more  individual feedback on these, but I decided
        to try something different this time. I'd like you to open your project back
        up and look at some things with me.
    </p>
    <p>
        These are a few of the common issues I saw in your assignments. Not in all
        of them, but whether this was an issue with your assignment or not, all may
        benefit from this collective feedback.
    </p>
    <p>
        These are <em>concerns</em>. They may not be errors, most of the form applications
        that I saw worked just fine and even if I saw some of these, I did not deduct
        any points for them.
    </p>

<div id="code-review" style="padding:20px; background-color:cyan;">
    <h3 class="alert alert-info">Code Review</h3>
    <p>
        These are what we would commonly call <em>findings</em> in a formal code
        review. A finding may be something that is incorrect, or doesn't match
        expected standad coding practices or just opportunities to improve the
        code.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the initial code review (or peer review) is complete, the findings
        are collected and recorded, usually tracked by the Quality Assurance (QA)
        team. The findings are presented to the creator and all are addressed by
        either a change to the artifact (the code) or by some other acknowledgement
        or clarifying response. Not all findings require <em>corrections</em>,
        but all findings need to be addressed.
    </p>
    <p>
        By the way, the QA team may track metrics such as how many findings per
        line of code, how long does it take for findings to be addressed (closed)
        and maybe how many findings are dismissed or corrected.
    </p>
    <p>
        After the creator and the reviewer agree that all of the findings have
        been addressed, the code can be integrated with the test build and the
        test team may take over.
    </p>
    <p>
        Of course this process will vary from team to team and project to project.
        But the general workflow will be similar.
    </p>
    <p>
        So let's consider my list of <em>findings</em> and you can look
        at your code and decide if any of these apply. And no, you won't need
        to make any corrections and resubmit them. After you've been through
        the list, I'll consider these closed and next time I may take points.

<div id="identifiers" style="padding:20px;">
    <h3 class="alert alert-info">Identifiers</h3>
    <p>
        Our textbook talks a little about identifiers. In fact <em>every</em> programming
        textbook will talk about identifiers. I wish it said more.
    </p>
    <h4 class="alert alert-info">Rules</h4>
    <p>
        The book lists rules for legal C# identifiers. In fact, these rules generally
        apply to all <em>C</em>-style programming languages, including C/C++/C# and Java.
        Most of these are common to other languages also, but for now we'll just consider
        these. According to the book:
        <ul>
            <li>Must start with a letter [a-z] or [A-Z] or an underscore (_). </li>
            <li>May also contain digits [0-9]. Can't start with any.</li>
            <li>May not contain spaces.</li>
        </ul>
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>But wait, there's more!</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        These are <strong>rules.</strong> There are also <strong>conventions</strong>
        and <em>best practices.</em>
    </p>
    <h4 class="alert alert-info">Conventions</h4>
    <p>
        As long as the rules are met, the conventions are really just suggestions.
        But consider them <em>strong suggestions.</em> Just because your code runs
        doesn't mean it is <em>correct.</em>
    </p>
    <p>
        Conventions make your code more consistent, easier to read and easier to
        understand, and by extension, easier to maintain and less error-prone.
    </p>
    <p>
        <em>C</em>-style languages, including C# use <strong>camelCase</strong>
        formatting for compound names. <strong>PascalCase</strong> is a specialized
        form of camelCase in which the first character is capitalized. It is
        named for the French mathemetician, Blaise Pascal, not for the programming
        language which also is named for him. Since it is his last name, the
        capital letter makes sense and is easier to remember.
    </p>
    <p>
        C# conventions usually expects camelCase for variables, and
        PascalCase for a class, record, struct, and public type members such as
        fields, properties, and methods.
    </p>
    <p>
        There's more, but just remember public -- capitalize, private -- lower case.
    </p>

    </p>
    <p>
        I do not know, but maybe we are to believe that it was preceded by 625 other
        efforts. In reality, it is the area code for the San Gabriel Valley area around
        West Covina and Pasadena, likely a significant location for one of the creative
        team.

        <strong>WD-40</strong> is a lubricant and rust-inhibitor created by the Rocket
        Chemical Company, now known as the WD-40 Company, renamed after its best known
        product, which in turn was named for the water displacement formula number 40.

        These are exceptions. Most of us know about "Agent-86" and "007", but generally
        speaking numbers aren't particularly descriptive.
    </p>
    <p>
        None of you should take this criticism personally. The course curriculum actually
        introduces this as "Project 1." But can we agree that this is a ridiculous name
        for this Project? I know! Whether I created it or not, I own this material, so I
        really need to update it.
    </p>
    <p>
        Names like <em>Project1</em>, and <em>Form1</em>, and <em>Label1</em>
        and <em>TextBox1</em> carry no special meaning to me. Tell me what they
        are and what they're for.
    </p>
    <p>
        I wonder if we could interview a former student and ask them what Label3 in
        Form2 from Project4 was supposed to contain.

        Last week I told you that <pre>heightInInches</pre> and <pre>distanceInKm</pre>
        are more meaningful than <pre>X</pre> and <pre>Y</pre>.

<div id="unnamed-constants" style="padding:20px;">
    <h3 class="alert alert-info">Unnamed Constants</h3>
    <p class="ic-flash-info">
        <strong>Finding #2</strong><br />
        Avoid using unnamed constants in your code.
    </p>
    <p>
        I already discussed this one last week (go back and read it again.)
    </p>
    <p>
<pre>valueA = double.Parse(classATextBox.Text) * 15</pre>
    </p>
    <p>
        Why 15? Why is this in the code and not defined as a constant near the
        top of the code? And if the same constant is used more than once in
        the code, that is much worse. Please be careful with these. They may
        be correct or not. They won't cause runtime exceptions, and they can
        lead to errors that can be very difficult to find and very difficult
        to correct.
    </p>
</div> <!-- #unnamed-constants -->

<div id="consistent-types" style="padding:20px;">
    <h3 class="alert alert-info">Consistent Types</h3>
    <p class="ic-flash-info">
        <strong>Finding #3</strong><br />
        Variable (and constant) type assignments should match.
    </p>
    <p>
        Sometimes named constants were used to hold the correct assignments
        for the ticket prices, but the wrong types were assigned.
    </p>
    <p>
        This initializes the value <pre>double CLASS_A_PRICE = 15</pre> but uses
        an integer, which the compiler, correctly casts to an integer, but
        implicit casts are not ideal. Try using <pre>= 15.0</pre> instead
        to ensure the value is set to a double, or use <pre>15M</pre> if
        you are using a Decimal variable type.
    </p>
    <p>
        Again, not an error, but matching the correct variable types makes
        your code clearer, and more reliable.
    </p>
</div> <!-- #meaningful-defaults -->

<div id="meaningful-defaults" style="padding:20px;">
    <h3 class="alert alert-info">Default Values</h3>
    <p class="ic-flash-info">
        <strong>Finding #4</strong><br />
        Should your variables be initialized with default values?
    </p>
    <p>
        Run your code again. There were 3 levels of tickets available. If you
        sold 1000 Class A tickets and 3 Class B tickets, what was the total?
        Did the calculation return anything when there were no sales entered
        for the Class C tickets?
    </p>
    <p>
        This is not an error, just an opportunity to make your code better.
    </p>
</div> <!-- #meaningful-defaults -->

<div id="output-format" style="padding:20px;">
    <h3 class="alert alert-info">Formatted Output</h3>
    <p class="ic-flash-info">
        <strong>Finding #5</strong><br />
        Check the format of your output.
    </p>
    <p>
        Two observations here, and again, most of these were really good, these
        are just some notes to check.
    </p>
    <p>
        Monetary (price, costs, sales totals) should be formatted as currency.
        This can be a little complex, but at the least, add a dollar sign in
        your output.
    </p>
    <p>
        One more related to output. This one I did not see as a problem for this
        example, but it becomes a common problem in later exercises, so I'll mention
        it now. Output results should be written as read-only text boxes, not labels.
    </p>
    <p>
        The reason is that textboxes, even read-only, can be selected and copy/pasted
        to other applications. Labels cannot. Try it. If your program has collected
        data and performed some calculations, you might want to reuse that data
        and manually typing it from one place to another doesn't make sense.
    </p>
</div> <!-- #output-format -->


<div id="tab-order" style="padding:20px;">
    <h3 class="alert alert-info">Tab Order</h3>
    <p class="ic-flash-info">
        <strong>Finding #6</strong><br />
        Set the tab order for your form elements.
    </p>
    <p>
        This one is a little more advanced and I wouldn't expect these to
        be correct on the first application, but try this on your next project.
    </p>
    <p>
        When the application starts is the cursor on the first input box? 
        Can you use the [Tab] key to advance to the next logical input, or control?        
    </p>
    <p>
        More advanced, does the [Enter] key perform the correct default
        <em>Submit</em> action? Does [Esc] exit the program? These are a little
        tricky to find, but once you do, it will make your programs better.
    </p>

    Take a look at your code. Are any of these helpful?
