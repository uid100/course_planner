        <div class="ic-flash-info">
            A <b>sequence</b> is a set of events or things that come
            one after another in a particular order.
        </div>

        <p>
            So much of what we do every day requires decisions and <em>sequential</em> logic
            <ul style="padding-left:50px;">
                <li>Open the door <strong>before</strong> you walk through it</li>
                <li><strong>If</strong> it is cold outside, grab a coat</li>
                <li><strong>While</strong> there is still work to do, keep workng</li>
                <li><strong>For</strong> all four car tires, check the air pressure</li>
            </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Another example</p>
        <p style="font-style:italic; padding-left:40px; padding-right:40px;">
            Park your car > turn off the engine > remove the key > take off your seatbelt
            > gather your things > open the car door > get out of the car > close the
            car door > IF the car is outside, THEN lock the car > walk to the front door
            > IF the front door is locked AND you have a key, unlock the door, ELSE
            knock on the door and wait for someone to open it > walk inside > IF it is
            dark, THEN turn on the lights.

            Of course this is a lot of detail that you don&#39;t need to think about
            all the time, maybe &quot;go home&quot; is enough to be understood.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            When you stop and consider, you will realize that everything you do all day
            is a series of things, and many of them are intentionally ordered in a
            logical sequence.
        </p>
        <p>
            Maybe you have driven to an appointment, walked from your car and across
            a parking lot and up a set of stairs and remembered that you forgot something
            in your car. The logic demands that you consider this new data and make a
            decision. You can go to the appointment without <em>the thing,</em> or
            walk back to the car and get it and come back, or walk back to the car
            and make another decision, maybe the walk was too far, and either move
            your car closer, or call and reschedule the appointment for another day.

    <div id="pseudocode" style="padding:20px;">
        <h2 class="alert">Pseudocode</h2>
        <p>
            <em>Pseudo</em> is an adjective which means false or immitation.
        </p>
        <p>
            A farmer might take an old set of worn out work clothes, stuff them with
            straw, add a hat and stand it up in a field. A <em>scarecrow</em> is
            a <em>pseudo-</em>farmer, or an imitation person intended to frighten
            away birds to keep them from eating the farmers crops. It cannot do the
            work of a farmer, it is not intended to fool anyone into thinking it is
            anything more than what it is, but for the purpose of scaring crows,
            it is adequate and more efficient than hiring an extra farm-hand to
            stand next to the fence all day scaring away the birds.
        </p>
        <p>
            Pseudocode is the simple expression of a logical <em>sequence</em> of
            steps that a process will take to complete a task. It is not intended
            to <em>fool</em> anyone into thinking that it is actual code. It is not
            meant to be executable by a computer it is simply the logical steps
            expressed in simple terms.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            For example, you might read the statement:
        </p>
        <pre style="margin:30px;">if(x>y){y++}</pre>
        <p style="font-style:italic; padding:30px;">
            if open parenthesis letter 'x' pointing to letter 'y',
            close parenthesis, and then add letter 'y' two times.
        </p>
        <p>
            In most <em>C</em>-style languages (C/C++/C#/Java), this is a logical
            and acceptable statement. Some of you might already know that it
            really means:
        </p>
        <p style="font-style:italic; padding:30px;">
            "if the value of x is greater than the value of y, then add 1
            to the value of y."
        </p>
        <p>
            By now you know that the first is <em>sourcecode</em> the second is
            <em>pseudocode.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Pseudocode should contain clear, simple terms. Imagine you were
            sharing it with your grandmother or the random person on the street.
            If they try to read it and have questions about what it means, it
            might not be clear enough.

    <div id="instructions" style="padding:20px;">
        <h2 class="alert">Instructions</h2>
        <p>
            There are three parts to this.
        </p>
        <h3>1. About you (6 points)</h3>
        <p>
            Share a little bit about ourselves; things like what you currently do, your major,
            why you are taking this class, what you would like to do after you finish your degree,
            hobbies, special interests, where you're originally from, where you live (general area),
            family, etc.
        </p>
        <p>
            Your post should have at least one or two good paragraphs so others in the class can
            find some things in common with you. Take this as an opportunity to get to know others
            in the class and make some new friends with people who enjoy some of the same things
            you enjoy (I.e., music, video games, travel, hiking, sports, etc.).
        </p>
        <h3>2. A typical day (6 points)</h3>
        <p>
            List at least 10 <em>things</em> that you might do in a typical day (these can be
            real or completely made up.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Number the items on the list in the order that they must be completed. Add IF
            statements (conditional) if they should be there. Do any of the items get repeated
            and if so, is it a fixed number of times, or until something changes? <em>
                Wash
                and rinse the car exactly 3 times, or wash and rinse the car until it is clean
                enough?
            </em>
        </p>
        <p style="background-color:yellow; text-align:center;">
            Parts 1 and 2 must be completed by Sunday Night at 1159PM so that others can reply.
        </p>
        <h3>3. Replies (4 points + 4 points)</h3>
        <p>
            After your initial post, find and share things you have in common with
            at least two other students who posted. Could you relate to their
            <em>typical day</em>?
        </p>
        <p>
            Replies should be thoughtful, positive, and respectful. 
        </p>
