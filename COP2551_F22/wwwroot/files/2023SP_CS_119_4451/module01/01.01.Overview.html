                        My career began in research. In that environment, I was primarily
                        responsible for finding creative solutions for real world data
                        collection and analysis in challenging environments. Sometimes it
                        meant writing software for instrument control and data processing
                        on a small ship rolling in heavy seas. Sometimes I was building
                        cabinets, designing and creating electrical and plumbing solutions
                        for a mobile shipboard lab facility. Sometimes it was negotiating
                        with shipping agents and import/export documentation in foreign
                        ports. Always, it involved a changing set of requirements,
                        analysis, design, and implementation.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Moving into the private sector, I ran IT departments for large
                        banking operations, again looking for creative solutions to apply
                        emerging technologies.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Then, for many more years, I worked as a systems engineer and
                        later project and program manager for large government
                        contractors.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        Project management and systems engineering have different
                        perspectives and approaches but they have many shared objectives.
                        In this course, we will explore the end-to-end activities that
                        are part of software solution development.

                    <p>
                        Although eah of the student projects will be individual efforts,
                        collaboration will be an important part of the experience also.

                    First, there are no scheduled meetings. Except of course
                    optional office hours. But you won&#39;t be doing this
                    alone. Office hours are a great place to check in, ask
                    questions, or just visit. <strong>Discord</strong> is a
                    good virtual meeting place, and a great place to ask and
                    answer questions and share ideas. And it&#39;s

                <h4>Classroom Meetings</h4>
                <p>
                    We will meet in class each week according to the course
                    schedule. Please by on time and treat our classroom as the
                    professional environment that it is. See syllabus for more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Assignments and quizzes are due each week. See the schedule
                    for dates. The materials for each module will be available
                    by the start of each week, and I will try and make them
                    available sooner. You should read the chapter and start the
                    exercises for each module before class. I will be going
                    over the materials, walking through examples, and answering
                    questions, but you will get more out of the class if it is
                    not your first time seeing the material.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Complete your assignments and get them submitted on time. It
                    is my goal to get your projects graded before the class meeting
                    the next week so that I can answer questions about them. I can't
                    guarantee that late assignments will be graded. Late and missing
                    assignments are not fair to me, to you, or to other students who
                    are turning them in on time. See the syllabus for more details
                    about my policy on late work.

                This course is designed to be very much a <em>hands-on</em>
                experience. Try and search for solutions when you run into
                challenges and try to apply them. There will be some reading
                and some videos to explain finer points of solutions development,
                and more importantly there will be opportunities to design
                and create.

            <h3>Canvas Modules</h3>
            <p>
                The class <i>container</i> here on Canvas is broken into modules
                corresponding to each chapter of the book. During each module, we
                will be covering the material from that chapter. Some of the modules
                will be completed in one week, some are scheduled across two weeks.
            </p>
            <p>
                You can see the schedule, module-by-module, and week-by-week at the
                bottom of the Syllabus. It is also summarized on the course home page
                or you can view the detail on the Canvas calendar.
            </p>
            <p>
                Keep track of the schedule for labs and quizzes. These are worth points!
                You are responsible for assignment due dates posted in Canvas. Noone
                will chase you to turn in assignments.
            </p>
            <p>
                In each chapter module, you will find learning resources such as
                PowerPoint slides, lecture notes, videos, sample Python code for
                many of the chapters, and links to assignments such as labs and
                quizzes. This week, we will be covering chapter 1 of the textbook.
            </p>
            <p>
                Being the first week of class, much of our activity this week is
                going to be orientation stuff like the syllabus, outline and lab
                standards, getting the textbook, downloading/installing the Python
                IDLE on your own personal computers and we will jump into chapter 1
                of the textbook.

            <h3>Notes and Resources</h3>
            <p>
                The goal of each module is to make available to you a variety of
                learning resources and give you an organized list of materials to
                help you master each chapter. Everybody learns differently so I'm
                going to leave it mostly up to you to choose and use the materials
                that help you learn best.
            </p>
            <p>
                The Power Point slides are from the publisher and correspond to the
                textbook.  Many people find these slides helpful as a study guide
                for the chapter and for taking notes. The quizzes and exams will
                follow the textbook.
            </p>
            <p>
                John Gerstenberg also teaches at Cuyamaca College and is the
                original author for much of the course content. I have included
                his lecture notes for each chapter. He emphasizes important concepts
                in the chapter, clarify tricky/difficult concepts and provides some
                sample Python code both to illustrate the chapter concepts and to
                save you the expense of buying a Python textbook. I've included
                these for you as an additional and valuable resource to help study
                or review the chapter and to help apply the information to the lab
                assignment.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are also assorted videos for each chapter that provide an
                additional learning resource, and links to various Python programming
                resources in the Python Help, Tutorials and Resources module.
            </p>
            <p>
                There may be helpful links on the #resources channel on Discord
                also, as well as friendly people to help answer questions. See
                the Discord link on the front page and the syllabus to join my
                server and online class discussions.

                If this is your first time taking any kind of programming course,
                don't panic - you're in the right place! It may not seem like it at
                times but really, you are. Learning a programming language is much
                like learning a foreign language or learning to play a musical
                instrument. The key and secret is practice! You have to immerse
                yourself and get involved hands-on. Simply trying to skim the chapter
                or a quick look at the sample code isn't going to do you a whole lot
                of good.

            <p>
                In almost every lab assignment, there will be at least one guided
                programming exercise designed to prepare you for completing the
                remaining lab exercises.
            </p>
            <p>
                We will work on these together in class but you are encouraged to
                work them on your own ahead of time and bring your questions and
                share your experience.

                Last, but not least, let's dive into the first chapter of the textbook.
                Chapter 1 provides a brief overview of programming concepts in general.
                If the material doesn't make sense right away, don't panic.
            </p>
            <p>
                In short, this chapter (briefly) introduces just about everything we
                will be covering in greater depth in the later chapters. In chapter 2,
                we will dig deeper into developing the logic for an application and
                building a fully functional Python application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Start with the book. Read the chapter. Consider watching the videos.
                These were prepared by the book&#39;s author. Next review John's lecture
                notes. And finally review the PowerPoint slides.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is the best way to study for the quizzes.

            Yes. There are probably a few. This is an evolving course and much
            of what you are seeing is very much a work in progress. If you have
            questions or find something that just doesn&#39;t make sense, it may
            well be that something is missing, incorrect,  images not appearing,
            broken links, or something that could just be clearer. Please let me
            know.

            Peer review and constructive feedback is always appreciated.
