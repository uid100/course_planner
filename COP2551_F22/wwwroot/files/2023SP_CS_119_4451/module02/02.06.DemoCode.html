        <p>
            Open this code in IDLE, walk through the source to
            see if you can follow all that is going on before you
            try and run it. After you run the code, try changing
            around a few lines to see what happens.
        </p>
        <p>
            The demo in this chapter uses the first of the 3 coding 
            structures: Sequential code where  one statement executes 
            after another. 
        </p>
        <p>
            This is also a good example of variable assignments
            and operations.
        </p>
        <p>
            What do you think of the variable names? Are they
            descriptive in the context of a simple calculator 
            application

        <p>
            Open IDLE and create a new file. Save it with a meaningful name,
            such as <em>helloworld.py</em>. The <em>.py</em> extension is
            important.
        </p>

        <p>
            Copy the following code into your file, save it and run it.

#Chapter 2 add 2 numbers demo

# from PLD page 33, an identifier is a class, method or variable name
# In Python, the typical naming convention is lower case with underscore _
# between words to improve readability
# The data type is determined by the initial value assigned
# Note we use a single = for assigning values in Python

# Declare variables
value1 = 0
value2 = 0
total = 0

# get input
value1 = int(input("Enter first value: "))
value2 = int(input("Enter second value: "))

# process
total = value1 + value2

# output - display total
print("Total = " + str(total))

            What happened? Did you test with big numebers and small numbers?
        </p>
        <p>
            What happens if you try to enter strings instead of numbers?
