            <p>
                This lab provides an introduction to programming in Python. You will be creating
                relatively simple Python console applications, and descriptive pseudocode using
                the Python&#39;s IDLE.
            </p>
            <p>
                It also gives you an opportunity to apply some of the terminology and concepts
                presented in chapters 1 & 2 of the PLD text.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are three exercises in this lab. Be sure to complete all three.

                <p>
                    Before starting on any lab work for this class, take a few minutes
                    to create a folder structure for your labs like the one shown below.
                    Being organized is a critical survival skill in software development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are using the classroom lab computers, be sure to create this
                    on your USB drive and be sure to save to it! Saving on the C: drive
                    of the lab computers is a disaster waiting to happen!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notice that the folders are numbered "lab01", "lab02", and so on. If
                    you number these using only a single digit, then when we labs 10, 11,
                    and 12, the natural ordering of your folders will be lab1, lab10,
                    lab11, lab12, lab2, lab3, ...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since there are more than 10, and less than 100, using 2 digit
                    numbers makes sense.

                    a working Python application using Python IDLE (Integrated

                <p>
                    The next step is to write the pseudocode. This should be a text (.txt)
                    document and it can be done with any text editor. Python IDLE can be 
                    used as well. It works out to be a nice way to keep things organized 
                    and score valuable points when you turn your work in for a grade.

                <h4>Steps</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Start Python IDLE.</li>
                    <li>From the File menu, click New File<br />
                        #
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Once the new file is created, save it right away as a text (.txt) file.
                        (Not a Python (.py) file!) Be sure to save it in your Lab 1 folder so 
                        you get points for it!<br />
                        #
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Write your pseudocode. Keep in mind there is no single 
                        &quot;correct&quot; way of doing this. This is perhaps what 
                        makes writing pseudocode confusing and difficult at first. 
                        Develop a style that helps you understand the problem and 
                        how you plan to code the solution. The sample shown below is a 
                        suggested approach.<br />
                            #
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Create a new file and save as <pre>multiply.py</pre> to your 
                        Lab 1 folder. Note that Python source files must have the .py
                        extension.<br />
                        If IDLE is saving as type <em>Python Files</em>, then the 
                        extension will be assigned for you. If you try and enter
                        &quot;multiply.py&quot;, you may end up with a file named
                        &quot;multiply.py.py&quot;. This is why it is important to 
                        enable file extensions in the <em>Before you begin</em> tab.<br />
                            #
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <ul>
                            Write the code shown in the Python code screenshot below.
                            Pay close attention to letter case. Note the following things
                            we will be doing for virtually every lab exercise:
                            <li>
                                Be sure to code the shebang line #!/user/bin/env python3. This line
                                does not belong in your pseudocode (.txt) file. This identifies the
                                file as an executable Python script file.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                In comments at the top, put in your name, course number and the lab
                                exercise information. See sample below.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Declare and initialize variables. You don’t have to show this in your
                                pseudocode but it may help to do so.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Use the input() method for getting user input.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Use the print() method for displaying output.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Use the int() method to convert text to an integer.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Use the float() method to convert text to a float.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Use the str() method to convert an integer value to string.

                            In the code below, a couple more things to note:

                                We declare variables using a concise, yet descriptive name.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Python determines the data type by the initial value.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                We use a single equal sign (=) for assigning literal 
                                values (i.e., 0, etc.) or the result of an expression 
                                to a variable.

            <p>
                In this exercise, you will create another Python application to
                convert kilometers to miles. Your application must allow the user
                to enter the number of kilometers and then convert and display
                miles.
            </p>

                <p>
                    1 kilometer = 0.62 miles.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the conversion factor that you are given. It must
                    be in your code. Do not lookup or calculateanother,

                </p>
            </div> <!-- #constant -->
            <p>
                Before writing any code, write some pseudocode as it will help you
                break down the problem into understandable pieces. It’s worth points!
                To save time, you may add your pseudocode for this exercise to the
                pseudocode file you created in exercise 1.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you do choose to combine your pseudocode in the same file,
                be sure to make a clear division between exercises.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will create a new Python source file (.py) in the Python IDLE
                the same way you did in exercise 1. The file name is left to your
                discretion but choose a reasonably concise, yet <em>descriptive</em>
                name for your project such as KmToMiles. Make sure you save the file
                in your Lab01 folder.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like exercise 1, be sure to code the shebang line and comments
                with your name, course No. and lab exercise.

            <p>
                In this exercise, you will create another Python application to
                convert miles to kilometers. This conversion is just the opposite
                of what you did in the last exercise! Your application must
                allow the user to enter the number of miles and then convert and
                display kilometers.
            </p>

                </p>
                <p>
                    This is the conversion factor that you are given. It must
                    be in your code. Do not lookup another, or calculate the
                    inverse. Any other values will produce (slightly) different
                    results. Use the supplied value.

            <h3>Pseudocode</h3>
            <p>
                Before writing any code, write some pseudocode as it will help
                you break down the problem into understandable pieces. It’s
                worth points! To save time, you may add your pseudocode for this
                exercise to the pseudocode (.txt) file you created in exercise 1.
            </p>

            <h3>Python Source Code</h3>
            <p>
                You will create a new source code (.py) file in the Python IDLE
                the same way you did in exercise 1. The file name is left to your
                discretion but choose a reasonably concise, yet <em>descriptive</em>
                name for your project such as MilesToKm. Make sure you save the
                file in your Lab01 folder.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like exercise 1, be sure to code the shebang line and comments with

                    Before submitting your assignment, step through this checklist to 
                    be certain that everything is complete. You should also check the
                    grading rubric to see if there is anything that you might have

                    Pseudocode should be simple, clear sequential instructions.
                    Think of this as how you would describe a process to your
                    roommate or your mom. It desribes the logic in simple terms.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Do not submit source code as pseudocode, they are not the 
                    same thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Make sure that your pseudocode is a text (only) file. Not
                    MS Word (doc, or docx) or from some other word processor.
                    RTF, PDF... Really. Just text files.
