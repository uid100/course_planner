            <dd>CS-119 is an is an introductory course in program design and development using Java or another object oriented programming language to serve as a foundation for more advanced programming, computer science or networking courses.</dd>
            <dd>This class emphasizes the development of problem-solving skills as it introduces students to computer science through the use of a modern object oriented programming language. Devotes attention to the development of effective software engineering practices emphasizing such principles as design decomposition, encapsulation, procedural abstraction, testing and software reuse.</dd>
            <dd>Students will learn and apply standard programming constructs, problem-solving strategies, the concept of an algorithm, fundamental data structures, and the machine representation of data, introductory graphics and networking.</dd>
            <dt>co-requisite</dt>
            <dd>The CS-119L lab section provides tutorials, lab exercises and programming projects intended to reinforce the programming and design concepts taught in the CS-119 section. Note that CS-119/CS-119L will be taught effectively as one course. Enrollment in CS-119L as a co-requisite is mandatory!</dd>
            <dd>Beyond the need to be registered for both courses, these will be tightly integrated and be treated as a singal course. There will be only one course in Canvas and the grade earned will be the recorded for 'both' courses.</dd>
            <dd>College policy requires me to drop students not enrolled in both sections!</dd>
            <dt><strong>pre-requisites / recommended preparation</strong></dt>
            <dd>None required.</dd>
            <dd>Completion of CIS-110 or a comparable introductory computer course is recommended. Students should be comfortable working with Microsoft Windows (7 or 10), using a web browser, uploading/downloading files, installing software and using Microsoft applications such as Word, Excel and Access.</dd>
            <dt>student learning outcomes</dt>
            <dd>
                Upon completion of the course, the student is expected to demonstrate practical applications of software engineering methodologies and practices as outlined below:
                <ol>
                    <li>Decompose problems and design program solutions using flowcharts, pseudocode, models, or other tools.</li>
                    <li>Properly code applications using the fundamental coding structures: sequence, selection, and loops.</li>
                    <li>Test and debug applications using debugging tools such as trace execution.</li>

                <dd>I will be using the Canvas Course Management system for class activities. You will be provided a login account once you are officially registered for the class. In addition to participating in online discussions, taking exams online and submitting labs online, I will provide various learning resources such as PowerPoint slides for each chapter, lecture/chapter notes, videos and code samples as needed to help you get through the chapter material. You are welcome and encouraged to use these learning resources in addition to the text material. Please feel free to ask if there's a particular code sample or a demonstration video that you need that isn't already available. I'm here to help you succeed.</dd>
                <dd>I will periodically (weekly or bi-weekly) post announcements to the Class Announcements page and/or send out e-mails to class members that may include things such as class announcements, assignment due dates, exam reminders, and answers to frequently asked questions. To ensure that you are "kept in the loop", please make sure your e-mail address in Canvas is an e-mail account you check on a regular basis.</dd>
                <dd>This class requires approximately 2 1/2 hours per week of laboratory time. Lab exercises and projects are intended to help reinforce the various program design and coding concepts being taught in the class. I will try to make the assignments "within reason" such that they can be completed within the allotted lab period but this may vary depending on the material and your prior experience. Due dates for each lab are posted in Canvas with the lab assignment. Please check the due date carefully and recheck periodically as I may adjust due dates depending on the needs of the class.</dd>

                <dd>Plagiarism hurts your personal &amp; professional reputation, the personal &amp; professional reputation of others, and the reputation of the college. Unless specified otherwise, all assignments in this class are to be completed and turned in on an individual basis. Even in the software industry, where most projects are done in a team environment, team members are expected to contribute substantial original effort to their assigned portion(s) of a project. Information technology professionals are expected to work to a high professional and ethical standard.</dd>
                <dd><strong> The bottom line: You will not gain any benefit from this course if someone else is doing all the work and thinking for you. Plagiarism will not help get you ahead in future classes that build upon this one nor will it help you get ahead in the workplace! </strong></dd>
                <dd>You are encouraged to share ideas and help each other but outright copying another's work (source code, documentation, etc.) will result in a zero score for all parties involved. Repeated offenses may result in referral for disciplinary action pursuant to the College guidelines for discipline in plagiarism matters. If you use the campus lab computers, make sure you take your personal storage media with you when you leave and don't leave hard copy source code/documentation lying around the lab or store your files in publicly accessible network folders.</dd>
