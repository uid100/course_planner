<p>As you've figured out by now, my name is Dan. I grew up in the San Diego, California. My parents and grandparents and great-grandparents were local to that area as well. I grew up near the beach surfing nearly every day in high school and started sailing competitively in college. I love being on, in, and near the ocea<span>n. </span></p>
<p><span>After graduating from college with a degree in Marine Geology, I worked in Oceanography for about 10 years and had amazing experiences seeing the world mostly from the deck of a ship. After our kids were born, being away from home for weeks and longer lost some of its appeal and I changed careers a couple of times, in part for salary incentives, but mostly for more family time. I worked many more years as a software engineer for government contractors mostly in the military sector, and as a program manager and director of engineering for most of the last ten years or so. My wife and I have three children, grown and moved or moving away. Our girls are out of state now, one married and living in Denver, with our first granddaughter, and one recently moved back to the mainland after spending two years on Kauai. Our son is recently married, working full time for a bio-medical lab and going to school part-time. My wife and I travel often, and we're very happy that we can see all the kids often.</span></p>
<p>I started teaching part time about 5 years ago, and full time for almost 2 years. When I did go back to school for a Masters degree, I was working and did that through an online program. I am very familiar with the challenges of being both an instructor and a student in online classes. I prefer being in face-to-face classes, but I also appreciate the flexibility of an online program, and the fact that so many people just wouldn't be able to attend college without the freedom that this technology brings.</p>
<p>I am looking forward to learning more about each of you, tell us a little about your background, and what you like most about online learning, and if you know, something about your short term and long term goals.</p>

<p>You'll hear me say this throughout the semester. &nbsp;I write code because it's fun!</p>
