            <p>
                There are two parts to this exercise. You will deploy and
                connect to Virtual Machines from the desktop and from the cloud.
            </p>
            <p>
                You will have some options for this exercise. Also,  
                the detailed instructions that you need may require some web
                searching. You're encouraged to share notes on the class'
                Discord channel. I'll add mine there too.
            </p>

                There are two weeks for this module, but get started as
                soon as you can.

            <p>
                In this first part, create a local virtual machine hosted on 
                hypervisor. You can do this either with VirtualBox or Hyper-v.
            </p>
            <ul>
                Select either:
                <li>VirtualBox (or)</li>
                <li>Hyper-V</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                VirtualBox is a no cost application available for Windows, Mac
                and Linux and I have run it successfully on all of these. There
                are many resources available online to get you started. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Hyper-v is Microsoft's virtualization product available for
                Windows 10 and newer. I have not used this, but I have seen the 
                demos for it and for Windows users, it looks like a good product.
            </p>
            <ul>
                Choose one:
                <li>Linux</li>
                <li>Windows</li>
                <li>Mac (within terms of EULA)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Once you've selected the virtualization environment, there are
                many virtual machine images available for running many different
                Linux variants, Windows images, or even MacOS. To install the 
                Mac OS on a virtual machine, you will need a product key. This 
                is not an easy hurdle to overcome. Windows images are available
                for temporary use without license restrictions, but if it will 
                be in use for longer (usually 30 days) then a license purchase
                is required. Linux images are generally available without a cost.
                Ubuntu is one of the most popular (Debian) variants. CentOS is
                also popular - it is a RedHat variant.
            </p>
            <p>
                Restoring an OSX (Mac) image to non-Apple platforms is not 
                consistent with Apple's licensing agreements. If you are running
                VirtualBox on a Mac, this is possible, but you will need to
                investigate the license issues on your own. I recommend against
                this to keep things simple.

            <p>
                Next create and connect to a virtual machine hosted on a cloud server.

            <p>
                I have virtual machines running on Azure, AWS, and GCP. You can choose 
                any of these. To build your VM.
            </p>
            <p>
                Just like you did with the Desktop images
            </p>
            <ul>
                Select a host
                <li>AWS</li>
                <li>Azure</li>
                <li>GCP</li>

            <p>
                <ul>
                    And an image
                    <li>Linux</li>
                    <li>Windows</li>

            <h4>Cloud</h4>
            <p>
                Even though my Azure VMs stop charging me when I stop the service
                (from the Portal), if they are using a static IP address, there is
                a nominal change for that. Also the disk storage for the system
                which can get large if I have a lot installed on the VM, is also 
                a charge separate from the VM image itself. I tend to create these
                often. Some I start and stop and use often when I need another computer,
                others, I build for a single task and delete when I'm finished. My 
                usage cost for my frequent use is usually between $5 and $20 per
                month. If you launch these and delete them again when you are done,
                your usage should be much less, and more likely within the free 
                usage tier.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you delete the virtual machine, delete the <strong>resource
                group</strong>, rather than the VM itself. The resource group will
                also delete the disk and release the network resources which might
                otherwise persist and become recurring costs.
            </p>
            <h4>Desktop</h4>
            <p>
                If you won't be using your local VM images, you can delete them also.
                My Linux VM images typically take up about 4+Gb of disk space each.
                Since these are located on your hardware, there won't be recurring 
                costs, but if you need the disk space, deleting them is recommended.
