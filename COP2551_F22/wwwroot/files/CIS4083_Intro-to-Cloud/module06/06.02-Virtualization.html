            <p class="ic-flash-info">
                Virtualization is the creation of a virtual version of something, such as an operating
                system, a server, a storage device, or network resources. It allows multiple systems to
                run on one physical device, increasing utilization, and providing flexibility and
                isolation for different workloads.
            </p>

            <p>
                Your computer likely consists of a set of input and output devices, some kind of
                long- and short-term storage capability and a processor to control them, complete
                processing tasks and control those devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                On top of this hardware layer is an operating system which is a collection of software
                that manages computer hardware resources and provides common services for computer
                programs. It acts as an intermediary between the user of a computer and the computer
                hardware, and controls the execution of application programs. The operating system is
                responsible for security, memory management, task scheduling, and input/output
                operations.
            </p>
            <p>
                Virtualization enables an operating system to be hosted on a set of hardware resoures
                that may not be on the same physical system.

            <h2 class="alert alert-info">VNC</h2>
            <h3>An Evolution</h3>
            <p>
                VNC stands for Virtual Network Computing and is a technology for remote 
                access and control of computers. The concept of VNC was first developed 
                in the late 1990s by the UK-based company AT&T Laboratories Cambridge. 
                The aim of the technology was to allow remote access to computers over 
                the internet in a way that was platform-independent and easy to use.
            </p>
            <p>
                The first version of VNC was released in 1998 as open-source software, 
                which allowed developers to freely use and modify the code. This 
                open-source approach quickly gained popularity, and the software was 
                adopted by a wide range of organizations and individuals. Over time, 
                VNC has evolved to include features such as encryption and authentication, 
                making it more secure for use in sensitive environments.
            </p>
            <p>
                Today, VNC is widely used by individuals, businesses, and organizations 
                for remote access and control of computers. There are several 
                implementations of VNC available, both as open-source software and as 
                commercial products. VNC is compatible with a wide range of operating 
                systems, including Windows, MacOS, and Linux, making it an accessible 
                and versatile tool for remote computing.

                Simply put, there were large Unix workstations in the office next
                door from mine. Prior to this, I could easily open a terminal session,
                or several from my desktop PC, instead of walking into the lab, but
                now, I could open GUI sessions to this computer in a windowed application
                on my computer, and my mouse actions and keyboard clicks would all
                be passed to the remote machine as if I was sitting in front of it.
            </p>
            <div id="fig1" style="text-align:center;font-style:italic;">
                <img src="/courses/455772/files/46434952/preview"

                <p>Remote Linux session from Mac using VNC</p>
            </div>
            <p>
                And more than that, this VNC server could also run on my PC, so that
                from my home computer, I could open a client session into my PC at
                work and like I did with the Unix workstation, I could interact from
                that remote location.
            </p>
            <p>
                Recent releases of Windows include this capability also in the RDS,
                or Remote Desktop Services. In fact, I'm typing this on my workstation
                which is a MacBook hosting a remote session to a PC sitting on a shelf
                across the room.
            </p>

                There are two keyboards, but they are both attached to the MacBook.
                Some of you may be aware that there are differences between some special
                keystrokes and the layout of the Mac and PC keyboards has subtle
                differences. I do switch between the keyboards sometimes, but they
                both work in whichever mode I'm working. There's usually a second point
                device (trackpad) on the desk too, but again, both systems support
                multiple input devices.
            </p>
            <p>
                When I don't need the PC, I can minimize or close the window and use both
                monitors for the MacBook.
            </p>
            <p>
                It was an arbitrary decision to host the PC from the Mac. In my upstairs
                office, I have a workstation that is set up to use my PC with a USB-C
                interface to control 2 monitors. Of course I can open a session to my
                MacBook from a PC there too and still be able to copy / pasted between the
                two systems. The difference is that I need to run VNC software instead
                of Windows' RDS, but really they work very much the same way.

            <h2 class="alert alert-info">Virtual Machines</h2>
            <p>
                So far, we've demonstrated that we can host a remote machine from another
                computer which may be located in another room, or across town, and use
                local input and output devices as if they were connected. Cool!
            </p>
            <p>
                We started out this discussion with a reminder of the hardware configuration
                that comprises a typical computer (I/O, processor(s), storage, operating 
                system, other software), and we demonstrated that we can connect remotely
                and share I/O (keyboard, monitor, etc.) as if they were locally connected.
                Now consider that the Operating System -which interacts with those devices 
                and launches and manages other software processes- could also be configured
                to run as a program on another computer. Actually, there is a piece of software
                called a Hypervisor which will run on a computer, and host another, or 
                several other, operating system(s) on it, as long as the host computer has
                enough resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                Like with the remote computer connection, I can click into the host window
                and interact with a separate computer, but the difference is, instead of
                the system running on a remote physical machine, it can borrow processor
                and storage resources from the host computer. In fact, if I have enough 
                resources, I can have many separate computer sessions running on my computer
                that only exist in memory.

            <h3 class="alert alert-info">Uses for Virtual Machines</h3>
            <p>
                So if you can run a virtual machine hosted on your computer or you can
                use connect to remote computer and operate it within your host computer,
                why not connect to a remote virtual computer running on a server in the
                cloud. The virtual machine works the same whether it is hosted on your
                local computer or the remote server, which is capable of running many 
                virtual machines at the same time.

            <h3>Testing</h3>
            <p>
                I have worked on many large government projects and when it came time to
                deploy these systems, there were always formal test requirements. Not 
                uncommonly, the project would train a group of users, using the official
                manuals and training materials developed with the project, then sets of 
                computers would be set up, often in remote locations, and these newly
                trained test players would put the computer systems through their paces.
                This was intended to prove that the system would perform with multiple
                users across real-world networks, and that the delivered training materials
                and user documentation was sufficient for the users to successfully complete
                the intended tasks. 
            </p>
            <p>
                As you can imagine, the costs associated with this type of event were high. 
                The training team had to be onsite for some period of time, often weeks.
                The (many) test players and observers had to be assigned to the task for 
                the duration of training and the formal test event(s). Systems and facilities
                needed to be arranged and procurred. These events could easily cost in 
                hundreds of thousands of dollars. And if there were tests ahead of time,
                which needed to be done to discover issues and mitigate risk, the cost would
                of course be more.
            </p>
            <p>
                Imagine that you need to ask your company for budget to purchase perhaps dozens
                of new computers to be set up for this event. Even large companies might be
                reluctant to do this. Now imagine instead, you could simply configure a VM 
                as your test client, even script the test inputs themselves, and write a 
                script to repeat this many times. Now, adding another 10, 20 or 50 computers 
                for the test event becomes very manageable and very affordable. Test with 100!
                And when the test is over, delete them.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another advantage of using VMs for testing, is if the software (system) is 
                still in development and has risk of crashing the computers, it's much
                easier to manage if the "machine" is virtual. The software crashed? If 
                it's contained in a Virtual Machine, then it can only affect that machine
                and the likelihood of corrupting the host machine is unlikely.
            </p>
            <h3>Standardization</h3>
            <p>
                A company with many employees might use virtual machines so that all of 
                their employees will have a pre-configured computer environment that is
                the same as every other. If a computer fails for some reason, you simply
                boot up another, and since they are all identical, there is no interruption
                to work. Maybe it's a customer service center or call center. Greatly reduced
                downtime and software licenses are easy to manage.
            </p>
            <p>
                For classes, I often will create a virtual machine to demonstrate installing
                software applications to a blank computer, without having to worry about
                a previous version being installed. In one class, the computers were shared
                with others outside of my class time, so to avoid data loss, I would connect
                to my virtual machine in the class, use it for teaching, then close it and
                reopen it from any other location, right where I left off in class without
                worrying that someone had changed something since the last session.
