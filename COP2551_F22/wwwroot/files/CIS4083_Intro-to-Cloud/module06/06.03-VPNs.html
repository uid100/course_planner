            <p>
                A virtual private network (VPN) is a technology that creates a secure,
                encrypted connection between a device and the internet. This connection
                allows users to transmit sensitive information, such as passwords and
                credit card numbers, securely over the internet. VPNs also hide a user's
                internet protocol (IP) address and location, making it more difficult
                for websites, internet service providers, and advertisers to track the
                user's online activity.
            </p>
            <p>
                VPNs are often used by individuals and businesses to protect their
                online privacy and security, especially when accessing the internet
                from public Wi-Fi networks. They can also be used to access restricted
                websites and content, such as streaming services that are not available
                in certain countries. VPNs can be set up on a user's computer, mobile
                device, or router, and there are also many VPN services available as
                subscription-based services.

            <h3>Local trust</h3>
            <p>
                As business reliance on networks has grown over the years, so
                has the concern about privacy and data security. It is generally
                accepted that computers that are connected to the local internal
                network are more <em>trustworthy</em> than unknown external systems.
                For this reason, there are Firewalls and other digital and physical
                safeguards in place to keep unknown or unwelcome traffic from the
                internal local network.
            </p>
            <p>
                A virtual private network connection can be established between
                two computers by establishing trust between them and creating a
                digital <em>tunnel</em> and encrpyting all network traffic
                between them. This trusted connection is assigned a network
                address to <em>appear</em> as if the traffic is coming from
                a computer that is connected directly to the local network.
            </p>
            <p>
                Because of this trust relationship, employees can use their company
                computers from remote locations, whether at home, hotel rooms,
                coffee shops, or customer facilities, and by establishing the
                dedicated connection, traffic flowing between them is considered
                reasonably secure from interception by outside listeners.

            <p>
                VPN (Virtual Private Network) connections are considered more
                secure for several reasons:
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Encryption: VPN connections use encryption to secure the data 
                transmitted over the internet. This helps prevent unauthorized 
                access to sensitive information, such as passwords and financial 
                data.</li>
                <li>Tunneling: VPN connections use a secure, encrypted "tunnel" 
                to transmit data between a device and a VPN server. This protects 
                the data from being intercepted or manipulated by third parties.</li>
                <li>Hide IP Address: VPN connections allow you to use a different 
                IP address, effectively hiding your real IP address and location 
                from websites and online services. This can help protect your 
                privacy and prevent websites from tracking your online activities.</li>
                <li>Secure Public Wi-Fi: VPN connections provide a secure connection
                when using public Wi-Fi networks, which are often unsecured and 
                vulnerable to hacking attempts.</li>
                <li>Remote Access: VPN connections allow for remote access to a 
                private network, enabling employees to securely access corporate 
                resources from outside the office.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Overall, VPN connections offer an added layer of security and 
                privacy to your internet connection, making them a useful tool 
                for anyone looking to protect their online activities and data.
