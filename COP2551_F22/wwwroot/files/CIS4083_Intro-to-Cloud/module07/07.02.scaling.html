            <p>
                A recurring theme in the discussion of cloud resources has been
                efficiency and cost of ownership vs operation. From the start,
                we considered the capital expense of purchasing, installing,
                configuring, and maintaining internet-accessible computing resource
                compared with the more practical approach of <em>piggy-backing</em>
                on existing resoures for the relatively shorter duration of use.
            </p>
            <p>
                Faced with the task to procure and deploy server resources,
                consideration must be given to peak demand, rather than average
                demand. Although most of the time, capital equipment may sit idle
                it needs to be adequate to meet the demand when it arises.
            </p>
            <p>
                By using cloud resources, much of that <em>idle-time</em> cost
                can be mitigated by scaling the resources to meet demand.

            <p>
                Cloud scalability refers to the ability of a cloud computing system
                to easily and efficiently handle an increasing amount of workload
                and users. It allows businesses and organizations to seamlessly
                expand or shrink their computing resources according to the changing
                demands of their users and applications, without having to invest
                in costly hardware upgrades or additional infrastructure.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is achieved by leveraging the cloud's ability to
                distribute computing resources dynamically across multiple servers
                and data centers, and by employing automated management and monitoring
                tools that can quickly allocate or de-allocate resources based on
                demand. This allows businesses to scale up or down their computing
                resources as needed, without experiencing any disruption in service
                or performance.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many cloud applications are very much <em>peak-driven</em>. That is, 
                there may be peak usage times which dominate the demand rather than
                a steady, predictable usage state.
            </p>
            <p>
                A ticket sales application for instance will likely experience a 
                much higher demand the day that tickets for a popular act are released
                or announced. Online tax preparation software will have a higher user
                load near a tax deadline than the rest of the month or year.
            </p>
            <p>
                When it comes to cloud scaling, there are two main approaches that can 
                be taken: horizontal scaling and vertical scaling.

                <strong>Horizontal scaling</strong>, also known as scaling out, involves adding more 
                computing resources, such as servers, to a system in order to increase 
                its capacity. This approach allows for increased scalability and can be 
                achieved by adding more instances or nodes to a distributed system. 
                Horizontal scaling is commonly used to handle large volumes of traffic 
                or to improve fault tolerance by spreading the workload across multiple 
                machines.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Vertical scaling</strong>, also known as scaling up, involves increasing the 
                capacity of individual computing resources, such as servers, by adding 
                more processing power, memory, or storage capacity. This approach can 
                be achieved by upgrading or replacing existing hardware components or 
                by adding more resources to virtual machines. Vertical scaling is often 
                used when a system requires more processing power or memory than what 
                is available on the current hardware.

                <p style="font-weight:bold">Horizontal</p>
                <p>
                    <em>Scale in or out</em> if your solution is optimized to share the
                    demand across more computers.
                </p>
                <p style="font-weight:bold">Vertical</p>
                <p>
                    <em>Scale up or down</em> if you need faster, or more powerful 
                    computer resources.
                </p>
            </div>
            <p>
                Horizontal scaling involves adding more computing resources to a system, 
                while vertical scaling involves increasing the capacity of existing 
                resources. Both approaches have their own advantages and disadvantages, 
                and the choice between them depends on the specific needs of the system 
                and its workload.

        <div id="elasticity">
            <h2 class="alert alert-info">Elasticity</h2>
            <p>
                Cloud scalability and elasticity are related concepts but have some
                important differences.
            </p>
            <p class="ic-flash-info">
                Scalability and Elasticity are not the same thing.
            </p>
            <p>
                Scalability is often achieved by distributing computing resources across 
                multiple servers and data centers and using automated management and 
                monitoring tools to quickly allocate or de-allocate resources based on 
                demand.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Cloud elasticity</strong>, on the other hand, is the ability of a cloud computing 
                system to <em>dynamically</em> adjust computing resources in response to changes 
                in demand. Elasticity focuses on the ability of a system to quickly and 
                automatically scale resources up or down as needed to maintain optimal 
                performance and cost efficiency.
            </p>
            <p>
                The key difference between cloud scalability and elasticity is that 
                scalability is about the ability to grow the computing resources to 
                accommodate demand, while elasticity is about the ability to adjust 
                the computing resources in response to demand. This is accomplished by 
                setting thresholds for resource usage and automatically adjusting 
                resource allocation in response to those thresholds.
            </p>
            <p>
                Scalability is about the ability to handle growth, while elasticity 
                is about the ability to adjust computing resources <em>dynamically</em>
                to optimize performance and cost efficiency.
