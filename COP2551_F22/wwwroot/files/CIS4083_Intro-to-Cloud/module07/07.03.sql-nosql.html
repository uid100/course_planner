                The referenced article from a Pluralsight blog post provides an introduction
                to defining databases. It is not a comprehensive study of databases, but it
                provides a good side-by-side comparison of <em>relational</em> (SQL) and
                <em>non-relational</em> (NoSQL) databases.

                    What are relational databases?

                <p>
                    A <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Relational_database" 
                         style="color:navy;"target="_blank">
                    relational database</a> stores data in tables and rows also referred to 
                    as records. The term “relational database” was first used in 1970 by E.F. Codd at IBM 
                    in his research paper “A Relational Model of Data for Large Shared Data Banks.” 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A <a href="https://www.pluralsight.com/courses/relational-database-design" 
                         style="color:navy;" target="_blank">
                    relational database works</a> by linking information from multiple tables through the use 
                    of “<i>keys</i>.” A key is a unique identifier which can be assigned to a row of data 
                    contained within a table. This unique identifier, called a “<i>primary key</i>,” can then 
                    be included in a record located in another table when that record has a relationship to the 
                    primary record in the main table. When this unique primary key is added to a record in 
                    another table, it is called a “<i>foreign key</i>” in the associated table. The connection
                    between the primary and foreign key then creates the “<i>relationship</i>” between records 
                    contained across multiple tables.

                <h2>
                    What are non-relational databases?
                </h2>
                <p>
                    In contrast, the non-relational database, or 
                    <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/NoSQL" target="_blank" style="color:navy;">NoSQL database</a>, stores 
                    data. However, unlike the relational database, there are no tables, rows, primary keys or 
                    foreign keys. Instead, the non-relational database uses a storage model optimized for 
                    specific requirements of the type of data being stored.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The five types of non-relational databases are: document data store, column-oriented 
                    database, key-value store, document store, and graph database.&nbsp; Often combinations 
                    of these types are used for a single application.
                </p>

                    <dt>Document data stores</dt>
                    <dd>
                        A document data store manages a set of named string fields and object data values 
                        in an entity referred to as a “document” typically stored in the form of JSON 
                        documents.<br />
                        The document stores do not require all documents to maintain identical data 
                        structures, which provides a great deal of flexibility. It’s easy to see then how 
                        this flexibility can be leveraged as an organization’s requirements change.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Columnar (or column oriented) data stores</dt>
                    <dd>A columnar data store organizes data into columns, which is conceptually similar 
                        to the relational database. The true advantage of a column-family database is in 
                        its denormalized approach to structuring sparse data, which comes from its 
                        column-oriented approach to storing data.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Key value stores
                    <dd>
                        This is the least complicated of the NoSQL databases. The key-value store is 
                        simply a collection of key-value pairs contained within an object.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Document stores</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Document stores are a bit more complex than key-value stores. The document 
                        store is designed to store everyday documents as is, and they (involve) more
                        complicated querying.
                    </dd>
                    <dt>Graph databases</dt>
                    <dd>
                        Last is the most complex non-relational database type. It’s designed to 
                        efficiently store relations between entities. When data is greatly 
                        interconnected, such as purchasing and manufacturing systems or referencing 
                        catalogs, graph databases are a good solution.
                    </dd>
                </dl>
                <p>
                    Instead of the Structure Query Language (SQL) used by relational databases,
                    NoSQL database uses Object-relational-mapping (ORM).

            <h3>A Database?</h3>
            <ul>
                The term <em>database</em> can refer to an application, a dataset, or a computer depending
                on the context.
            <li>
                A <em>database</em> may refer to a software application that is used to store and manage large 
                amounts of data. Examples of database applications include Oracle, MySQL, and Microsoft 
                SQL Server.
            </li>
            <li>
                A <em>database</em> can refer to a collection of data that is organized in a specific way to allow 
                for efficient storage, retrieval, and modification. Databases can be used to store many 
                types of data, including text, images, and numerical data.
            </li>
            <li>
                Or, a <em>database</em> may refer to a physical or virtual storage device that is used to store 
                data. This can include hard drives, solid-state drives, and cloud-based storage services.
            </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Cloud providers commonly provide database services as supported Platform-as-a-Service 
                (PaaS). These are sometimes referred to as DBaaS or Database-as-a-Service.
            </p>
            <p>
                This unfortunate ambiguity may lead to confusion. And to make things worse, all of these
                are correct!
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>
                The client-server nature of the database application, and the tendency for these installations to 
                be commonly hosted on dedicated computers, makes this <em>service</em> an ideal candidate
                for cloud providers. And it is no surprise that the leading cloud providers do provide
                ready-to-implement solution platforms to host datasets as relational or non-relational 
                configurations.
            </p>
            <p>
                These cloud database solutions are considered Platform-as-a-Service because they are not
                end-user applications (SaaS), and while they are highly configurable, they do not require
                software installation and server maintenance as an Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS) would.
                They are generally considered <em>turn-key</em> utilities, ready for datasets to be 
                written to and utilized.
