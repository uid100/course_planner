            <h2 class="alert alert-info">Azure SQL Database-as-a-Service</h2>

            <p>
                Azure training documents reference the benefits of using Azure 
                SQL database as a service in contrast to creating a virtual 
                machine, then installing and configuring and managing the 
                system, firewall(s) and a SQL server instance.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the Spring of 2020, there was a high demand on cloud resources
                as the world pivoted to a work-remote situation. In fact, in spite
                of a global crisis response, there were surprisingly few major 
                cloud service interruptions. Much of the increased demand was
                mitigated by scaling and deprioritizing non-critical resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                During that time, some services noticed significantly higher 
                lag times. Deploying new web applications for instance, especially
                with <em>Educational</em> subscription agreements, might take as
                long as 30 - 60 seconds, compared with the much faster response
                times that had become the expectation.
            </p>
            <p>
                Another area that (we) experienced a constraint was creating new
                database services. Again, this seemed to be limited to (our) academic
                subscriptions, which were deprioritized to meet increased customer
                demand.
            </p>
            <p>
                In our program, we had several concurrent student projects with
                step-by-step instructions to configure and deploy an Azure SQL
                server instance, populate, and access the database. These particular
                projects required access from remotely distributed individuals, as
                well as Azure cloud-deployed web applications. Using a local database
                solution was not an acceptable option, and in the temporary situation,
                using the Azure SQL Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS) solution was not
                supported and we were uncertain when the service would be restored.

            <p>
                In this first part, create a local virtual machine hosted on 
                hypervisor. You can do this either with VirtualBox or Hyper-v.
            </p>
            <ul>
                Select either:
                <li>VirtualBox (or)</li>
                <li>Hyper-V</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                VirtualBox is a no cost application available for Windows, Mac
                and Linux and I have run it successfully on all of these. There
                are many resources available online to get you started. 
            </p>
            <p>
                Hyper-v is Microsoft's virtualization product available for
                Windows 10 and newer. I have not used this, but I have seen the 
                demos for it and for Windows users, it looks like a good product.
            </p>
            <ul>
                Choose one:
                <li>Linux</li>
                <li>Windows</li>
                <li>Mac (within terms of EULA)</li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                Once you've selected the virtualization environment, there are
                many virtual machine images available for running many different
                Linux variants, Windows images, or even MacOS. To install the 
                Mac OS on a virtual machine, you will need a product key. This 
                is not an easy hurdle to overcome. Windows images are available
                for temporary use without license restrictions, but if it will 
                be in use for longer (usually 30 days) then a license purchase
                is required. Linux images are generally available without a cost.
                Ubuntu is one of the most popular (Debian) variants. CentOS is
                also popular - it is a RedHat variant.
            </p>
            <p>
                Restoring an OSX (Mac) image to non-Apple platforms is not 
                consistent with Apple's licensing agreements. If you are running
                VirtualBox on a Mac, this is possible, but you will need to
                investigate the license issues on your own. I recommend against
                this to keep things simple.

            <h4>Cloud</h4>
            <p>
                Even though my Azure VMs stop charging me when I stop the service
                (from the Portal), if they are using a static IP address, there is
                a nominal change for that. Also the disk storage for the system
                which can get large if I have a lot installed on the VM, is also 
                a charge separate from the VM image itself. I tend to create these
                often. Some I start and stop and use often when I need another computer,
                others, I build for a single task and delete when I'm finished. My 
                usage cost for my frequent use is usually between $5 and $20 per
                month. If you launch these and delete them again when you are done,
                your usage should be much less, and more likely within the free 
                usage tier.
            </p>
            <p>
                When you delete the virtual machine, delete the <strong>resource
                group</strong>, rather than the VM itself. The resource group will
                also delete the disk and release the network resources which might
                otherwise persist and become recurring costs.
            </p>
            <h4>Desktop</h4>
            <p>
                If you won't be using your local VM images, you can delete them also.
                My Linux VM images typically take up about 4+Gb of disk space each.
                Since these are located on your hardware, there won't be recurring 
                costs, but if you need the disk space, deleting them is recommended.
