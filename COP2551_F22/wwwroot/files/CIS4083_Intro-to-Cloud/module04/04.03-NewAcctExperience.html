            In the last module, you were asked to create accounts for
            both Azure and AWS cloud services, and given little to no
            direction for doing that.
        </p>
        <p>
            I'm interested in your individual and collective exerience.
        </p>
        <p>
            In 3 to 5 paragraphs, tell us about that. Did you have
            concerns about signing up for these services? Was the process
            simple or confusing? What questions came up while you were
            doing this?
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Discussion - Replies (25pts)</h3>
        <p>
            Provide thoughtful (respectful) posts to at least two other
            students replying to their posts.
        </p>
        <p>
            Have you already completed the Azure Web App project for this
            week? After experiencing and planning and forecasting cloud
            service pricing for development projects, does it change your
            any opinions or thoughts that you had in your original post?
