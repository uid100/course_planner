        <p>
            Before you can start using cloud computing resources, you will need
            to create a new account.
        </p>
        <p>
            For this assignment, you will create an account for the two largest
            Cloud Service Providers, AWS and Azure. We'll add a third, Google
            Cloud as part of another assignment.

            <p class="ic-flash-info">
                If you already have an <strong>Azure</strong> account, you can review
                these steps but you do not need to create another account. Proceed to
                the next step and <strong>Submit</strong>

            <div id="pronounce" class="alert" style="padding:30px;">
                <p>
                    <em>How do you pronounce "Azure?"</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most people have very strong opinions about this. There are two
                    common pronunciations and <strong>both are acceptable</strong>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Azure</strong> is from the french word azure, and is very much
                    a part of the English language. The preferred common pronunciation within
                    the United States is <em><strong>AZH</strong>-uhr</em>, while in the UK the
                    emphasis is more commonly on the second syllable,
                    <em>az-<strong>ZHOOR</strong></em>.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <em>But which do they use at Microsoft?</em>
                </p>
                <p>
                    Having many friends and associates working at and for Microsoft and the
                    Azure team, I can tell you first-hand that there really isn't a consensus.
                    In Redmond, the American pronunciation is more common, and I have worked
                    with Microsoft employees in Canada who unsurprisingly preferred the French
                    pronunciation more common in the UK.
                </p>
                <p>
                    So, which should you use? Either is acceptable, but before you take a stand,
                    neither is <em>incorrect.</em>

                Create the account in each of the cloud service providers as described.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, login to your account and take a screenshot showing the main
                dashboard and your active account.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                Here is an example logged into the Azure Portal. This was using the
                Google Chrome browser on a Macbook Pro
            </p>
            <p>
                <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"
                     src="/courses/455772/files/46216408/preview"
                     alt="Azure portal on Mac" width="800" />
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                And another, this time also using Chrome on a Windows 11 notebook.
            </p>
            <p>
                <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"
                     src="/courses/455772/files/46216516/preview"
                     alt="AWS dashboard from Windows" width="600" />
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                <strong>Note:</strong> when you take your screenshots, size the window
                down to something reasonable and clip only the relevant content.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong><em>Do not use Print Screen.</em></strong>
            </p>
            <p>
                With <strong>MacOS</strong>, use <strong>shift-command-4</strong> and click
                and drag the crosshair across the required area.
            </p>
            <p>
                Using <strong>Windows</strong>, use the <strong>Snipping Tool</strong>
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                Save your screenshots as common image formats, I prefer jpeg (.jpg),
                Portable Network Graphic (.png) is also fine. It is the default from
                the Mac capture.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upload both of these files to Canvas. If you are having difficulty
                submitting both files, you may zip them into a single (not individual)
                zip archive file. Do not use tar or cpio or 7zip or any other compression
                tool. These image files are already compact formats, so uploading the
                original image files is preferred. Do not attach them to the Canvas
                Comment window. I will not see the attachments.
