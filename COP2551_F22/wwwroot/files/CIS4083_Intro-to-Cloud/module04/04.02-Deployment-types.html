            You know now that this meme only tells part of the story. Let's look at more.

        <h2 class="alert alert-info">A Look Back</h2>
        <p>
            <img style="float: right;"
                 src="/courses/455772/files/46214814/preview"

        </p>
        <p>
            You learned that the cloud metaphor was originally used to abstract the complexities
            of network details. The <em>cloud</em> was adopted as a simplified drawing to indicate
            a <em>cloudy</em> reality for real infrastructure but the details could be obscured or
            hidden because those details weren't important to the context of the drawing(s) where
            this technique was being used.
        </p>
        <p>
            This vague idea of the cloud was similar to the use of a <em>black box</em> in engineering
            where a magic container is presented which hides the details of a particular system
            or process. Yes, there are things happening in there, but instead of looking inside,
            focus is on the inputs and results.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>Historical Context</h3>
        <p>
            Cloud computing services as an industry, was born following the dotcom bubble.
            <a style="color:navy;"
               href="https://www.thestreet.com/dictionary/d/dot-com-bubble-and-burst">
                You can read about the economic climate of the time here.
            </a>
        </p>
        <p>
            Tech stocks in the stock market showed unprecedented and unsustainable gains.
        </p>
        <p>
            The internet was becoming a household reality. In the early days of the internet,
            domain name registration was more regulated than it is today. Primary domain
            extensions were more limited and assignment was less arbitrary. As you would
            expect, <em>.gov</em> and <em>.edu</em> extensions were reserved for qualified
            government and educational institutions. <em>.net</em> was reserved for communications
            companies, <em>.org</em> suggested not-for-profit organizations and <em>.com</em>
            was the extension that indicated commerce. In those days, network presence, and a
            <em>web-page</em> carried a perception of legitimacy.
        </p>
        <p class="ic-flash-info">
            <em>
                Of course it's a real company,<br />
                they've got a website and everything!
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The market responded. Established tech companies and startups with a good story were
            attracting investors and speculators, and there seemed there was no end in sight. Of course
            it's called a bubble for a reason. And when the hype met its logical conclusion, many
            companies were faced with dusting off and finding creative ways to survive.
        </p>
        <p>
            Amazon was one of those companies. This was a company that started as an online bookstore.
            This alone was an unusual idea. Book shoppers traditionally wanted to go to bookstores.
            To the demographic, the book shopping experience suggested colorful displays, peaceful,
            warm, quiet places to leaf through pages of bound treasures. Many thought the idea of
            ordering a book on the internet that you had never held and looked at, simply couldn't
            catch on.
        </p>
        <p>
            Of course there was more to it. Mall real estate, the haven of traditional bookstores,
            was expensive. And the market for affordable books reached beyond the mall. Best seller
            lists could be leveraged into order opportunities. For a while, Amazon was quietly
            successful. There was even a very public lawsuit filed by Barnes and Noble Booksellers
            when Amazon claimed to be the "world's largest bookstore."
        </p>
        <h3>A Turning Point</h3>
        <p>
            <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"
                 src="/courses/455772/files/46214378/preview"
                 alt="Downward line graph" width="250" height="267" />
        </p>
        <p>
            As an e-commerce, dot-com company, Amazon was also on that economic ride and shares of
            their stock climbed to around $113 in 1999 and tumbled back to about $5 two years later
            when the market correction occurred. But through this, Amazon grew. There is a lot of
            interesting business logic for why their business model was working, even when indicators
            might have suggested otherwise.
        </p>
        <p>
            But here was a growing e-commerce player, expanding their business model to other products,
            selling inventory they didn't need to own, and collecting payments in realtime. Their
            relative available investment revenue was very healthy. And here was the distinction,
            they continued to invest in their online footprint and while others were considering that
            the rising cost of entry to internet commerce was prohibitive, Amazon was perfectly
            positioned with infrastucture in place when this new concept of offering computing
            services was conceived and Amazon Web Services or AWS was created.

        <h2 class="alert alert-info">What Services?</h2>
        <p>
            In the last module you researched some of the larger Cloud Service Providers (CSPs).
            Internet Service Providers (ISPs) had existed for a while as access points for consumers
            to join the network. Cloud computing services was bringing a new idea of accessing
            remote resources with little to no capital investment for individual server
            infrastructure.
        </p>
        <p>
            As you discovered in the last module, there are many companies providing these shared
            services, but just a few that are set apart from the others, most notably AWS, and
            Microsoft's Azure both have a strong lead in global market share and the third spot
            has shifted a few times in recent years.
        </p>
        <p>
            Considering what we know about how the industry has grown, this likely does not come
            as a surprise. <em>In my opinion,</em> AWS is the largest player, largely because
            they were the first player and heavily invested in the capability.
        </p>
        <p>
            It is my intent to provide you with an unbiased picture of the industry and encourage
            you to draw your own conclusions from what you find on your own. My opinions can't
            help but be influenced by my own experience and observations. AWS, Microsoft, and
            Google are major companies and industry leaders. They are not the only ones, they
            are the largest.
        </p>
        <p>
            I am repeating this because some of the materials that you will find and that I will
            share with you are unapologetically branded by one of these companies. They are not
            sponsors of this course, and I hope that you leave with a broad view of the technology,
            but I also won't avoid using some of these obviously brand-specific materials, and
            even some of their training media because a lot of it is quite good, helpful, and
            informative.
        </p>
        <p class="ic-flash-info">
            I will try to use <strong>AWS</strong> to distinguish it from the giant e-commerce
            parent company, <strong>Amazon</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            I've described a little of the historical context which led to AWS becoming a leader
            in this new industry. It is worth taking a look at some of the technical background
            also.
        </p>
        <p>
            As part of their recovery, Amazon began working to refactor their code in order to
            step in as a vendor to host other retailers, by decoupling their code tp support this
            new approach.
        </p>
        <p>
            At first, this <em>service as a product</em> was a set of APIs for accessing the
            Amazon retail catalog and soon remotely hosted data storage, they called this
            first product <strong>Simple Storage Service</strong> or simply <strong>S3</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Amazon (soon AWS) continued to develop service offerings including their messaging
            API (Simple Queue Service or SQS) and infrastructure computing resources, known
            as the Elastic Compute Cloud (EC2) which enabled organizations to lease computing
            resources and scaling up and down (elastic) or using more or less services as
            their needs changed. More products followed and service expanded to Europe.
        </p>
        <p>
            As web technologies were evolving in parallel, Google began offering computing
            services to integrate into hosted web applications called the <strong>
                Google
                App Engine
            </strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            After more years of growth and development passed, software giant Microsoft
            launched their competing Azure cloud service around 2010.

            More than just web hosting or online storage; now, with a better understanding
            of the terms and concepts, take another look at just what these <em>
                cloud
                computing services
            </em> can do.
