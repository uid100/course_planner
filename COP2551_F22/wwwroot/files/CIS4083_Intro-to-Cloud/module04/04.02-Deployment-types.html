            Four cloud deployment models are widely recognized:
            public clouds, private clouds, community clouds, and hybrid clouds.
        </p>
        <p>
            A cloud deployment model is defined according to where the
            infrastructure for the deployment resides and who has control
            over that infrastructure.

            Questions to consider:
            <ul>
                <li>What is the relationship of overhead to deployment model?</li>
                <li>
                    Which do you think represents the <em>most</em> secure? Is it
                    a different answer for different applications?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Aside from initial investment, what are the factors which
                    might drive continuing operating costs for each one?
                </li>
                <li>What are compelling reasons for selecting one over another?</li>
                <li>
                    Can you think of applications which would be best-fit for each
                    of the four (or five)?
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            This is an important topic, and although there is nothing to
            submit for this assignment, be sure to spend some time reviewing
            the material(s).
