            <p class="ic-flash-info">
                The term "serverless" refers to the fact that the cloud provider is responsible
                for managing the servers, so the developer doesn't have to, but the servers still
                exist.
            </p>
            <h3>Background</h3>
            <p>
                PaaS (Platform as a Service) and serverless computing are related, but distinct,
                cloud computing models.
            </p>
            <p>
                PaaS provides a platform for developing, running, and managing applications and
                services, typically offering a complete runtime environment, development tools,
                and a hosting environment. It abstracts the underlying infrastructure and provides
                everything needed to build and run applications and services, including servers,
                storage, databases, and other services.
            </p>
            <p>
                Serverless computing, on the other hand, is a way of building and running
                applications and services without having to manage infrastructure. It allows
                developers to focus on writing code that runs in response to specific events
                or actions, such as a user request or a database change, rather than managing
                the underlying servers. The cloud provider manages the servers, dynamically
                allocates resources, and charges for usage, rather than for a set amount of
                resources.
            </p>
            <p>
                In short, PaaS is a complete platform for application development and
                management, while serverless computing is a way to build and run applications
                without managing infrastructure.

                <p style="font-style:italic;">
                    Let's think about it another way.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you need a task completed, you could select someone at random, teach and
                    train them and then direct them to complete the task. This is the equivalent
                    of Infrastucture as a Service (IaaS). You can specify physical traits, size and
                    strength perhaps, but ensuring that they know what they are doing is up to you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Alternatively, you could hire a qualified employee, someone who already
                    understands your business or working environment, then give them the task and
                    supervise the completion of the task. This is similar to Platform as a Service
                    (PaaS). Like IaaS, you can scale certain parameters, and you can adjust them
                    as needed, but the cloud provider ensures that the service is pre-configured
                    to certain capabilities, perhaps as a database or a web server.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, you could take that same task and simply hire a contractor, who is
                    responsible for ensuring they assign a qualified candidate, and the contractor
                    will oversee the employee to ensure the task is completed. With this serverless
                    computing, if the coded solution demands more or less resources, the cloud
                    provider can scale and configure as needed. This more hands-off approach
                    is usually more efficient.
                </p>

                But where/why/when would I use these?
            </p>
            <p>
                To put these <em>serverless functions</em> into context, consider the life cycle 
                of an application.
            </p>
            <p>
                Simple console utility applications might be called from the command line, perhaps
                take some input from the keyboard or from the system, complete some processing, and
                then exit. If they are well-behaved, they release all of their memory and resources
                and although they may be kept in storage to be called again, they are no longer
                active in the processor or the computer's active memory.
            </p>
            <p>
                A web application, including an API, starts when it is deployed. The application
                usually completes some initial definitions and configuration and then it starts
                up a listening thread to wait. Don't confuse this with a web server, which is 
                listening for network requests and then passing them along to this waiting 
                application. When the web application receives the http request, it may launch a 
                new listening process before continuing with its processing to construct the
                response and exiting, but there should always be more listeners waiting for more
                requests (up to a limit.)
            </p>
            <p class="ic-flash-info">
                The web application is running whether there are any active requests or not.
            </p>
            <p>
                In contrast. <em>serverless functions</em> are in storage but not actively running
                until they are needed. In most cases, this means less processing time and lower
                operating cost.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you need to automatically send an email to all of your customers on the 
                first of every month, that might get fresh data from a database call or from
                an API, lookup the email addresses it needs to broadcast to, and then format
                the message and send the email batch. It might be busy for a minute or so once
                every month, but it isn't efficient to keep it running all month only to check 
                the time a few times each second.
            </p>
            <p>
                As another example, a resort's website could display photos, tour information
                and rates, and maybe poll some local equipment to display current weather 
                conditions. Rather than maintain the connection to the weather station, that
                interaction could be generated by a trigger sent from the web application, 
                run the functions, return the data and then exit.
            </p>
            <p>
                Here are some other use cases
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        Web applications and static websites: Serverless architecture can 
                        handle dynamic web traffic while reducing infrastructure costs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Event-driven and microservices-based applications: Serverless 
                        computing allows developers to build small, independent functions 
                        that respond to specific events, such as changes in a database or 
                        messages from a queue.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Big data processing: Serverless computing can handle large amounts 
                        of data processing, such as data analytics and machine learning, 
                        by scaling computing resources automatically.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Mobile backends: Serverless computing can provide scalable and 
                        cost-effective backends for mobile applications, without having 
                        to worry about server infrastructure.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Internet of Things (IoT): Serverless computing is ideal for IoT 
                        applications that require real-time processing of large amounts 
                        of data generated by devices.
                    </li>
                </ul>

            <h2>Triggers</h2>
            <p>
                Software triggers are events or conditions in a software system that 
                initiate an action or process. They are often used in database management 
                systems to automatically perform specific tasks, such as updating records 
                or sending notifications, when certain conditions are met. For example, 
                a trigger can be set up to automatically update a record whenever a change 
                is made to a certain field, or to send an email notification whenever a 
                new record is added to a database. They are an effective way of automating 
                repetitive or complex processes and can save time and increase efficiency.

            <p>
                AWS calls their serverless computing product <strong>Lambda Functions</strong>. If you've used LINQ in C#, don't
                confuse these with <em>lambda expressions,</em> they are not related. Google calls them <strong>
                    Google Cloud
                    Functions
                </strong> and Microsoft has <strong>Azure Functions.</strong>
