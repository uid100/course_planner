        Introductions
    </h3>

    <h3>Purpose:</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Since we don't have the opportunity to go around the classroom and have 
            people introduce themselves, we're going to do an online introduction 
            and share a little bit about ourselves.
        </li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3>Directions:</h3>

    <ol>
        <li>(5 pts) Add your picture to your Canvas profile. From the Canvas main 
        menu (typically on the upper left side of your screen), select Account and 
        go to Settings and upload a picture.

        <li>
            (40 pts) Click reply below, and add a post introducing yourself to the 
            class. Share at least one or two good paragraphs so others in the class 
            can find some things in common with you. Ideas might include: what you 
            currently do, your major, why you are taking this class, what you would 
            like to do after you finish your degree, hobbies, special interests, 
            where you're originally from, where you live (general area), family, 
            etc. You can upload pictures if you want to. What's your Discord username 
            and why did you choose it?
