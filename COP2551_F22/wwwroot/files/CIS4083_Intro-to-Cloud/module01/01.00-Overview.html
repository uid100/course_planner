                &quot;<strong>Cloud Computing</strong> is the <strong>on-demand</strong> 
                delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT 
                resources <strong>via the internet</strong> with <strong>pay-as-you-go</strong>

                At the end of this module, you should be able to describe the cloud, what it
                is, what it can do, and how it came to be.

        <h3>All of <em>Us</em></h3>
        <em>Really? Again?</em> (Yes, of course.)
        <ul style="margin-left:10%;">
            <li>
                In polite society, we meet and introduce ourselves. It's not a bad thing.<br />
                And I have a Discussion board set up just for that purpose. (<em>Hey, you can
                get easy points for it!</em>)
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3>All of <em>This</em></h3>
        <em>How is this going to work?</em>
        <p>
            First, there are no scheduled meetings. Except of course optional office hours.
            But you won&#39;t be doing this alone. Office hours are a great place to check in,
            ask questions, or just visit. <strong>Discord</strong> is a good virtual meeting
            place, and a great place to ask and answer questions and share ideas. And it&#39;s
            always there!
        </p>
        <p>
            This course is designed to be very much a <em>hands-on</em> experience. You will
            be expected to search for solutions when you run into a challenge and try to apply 
            them. There will be some reading and some videos and some quizzes to evaluate 
            a <em>conversational</em> level of understanding ("can you talk about the subject
            and recognize the terminology?"), and more importantly there will be opportunities
            to see and touch and use the technology.
        </p>
        <p>
            One of my objectives is that this course reliably present the current state of
            the industry. (Really. Today!)
        </p>
        <p>
            That is one of the primary reasons that there is no <em>printed</em> textbook.
            There will be a lot of outside referenced resources, papers and videos. When 
            you see these, it is strongly recommended that you consider the age of the resource.
        </p>
        <p>
            Given the recent and rapid evolution of this topic, if you want to discover what
            it looks like today, then let&#39;s look at it.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>What about certificates?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            Certificates certainly have value and add credibility to a resume as a means to
            support knowledge claims. This course is intended to provide an introduction to
            cloud computing and cloud technologies. We will be surveying different approaches
            to solving similar problems using different vendors. (<em>read that sentence 
            again.</em>) This course will better equip you to pursue one of the many worthwhile
            cloud certificates, but without the focused detail that they require. This is more 
            about understanding the <em>what</em> and the <em>why.</em>

        <p>
            Yes. There are probably a few. This is an evolving course and much of what you are
            seeing is very much a work in progress. If you have questions or find something that 
            just doesn&#39;t make sense, it may well be that something is missing, incorrect,
            images not appearing, broken links, or something that could just be clearer. Please 
            let me know. Peer review and constructive feedback is always appreciated.
