                Often, system engineers have a need for either physical or logical network diagrams 
                either for describing existing infrastructure, or designing new capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Typically, these diagrams are representations, or abstractions. In other words they 
                are useful to record and communicate important elements and masking less relevant 
                details.

                In this example, it is likely that there are various ethernet cables, perhaps
                terminated and plugged into wall outlets, connecting to wires led through the
                building and led to closets with punch-down panels and patch cables, but the 
                data relevant to the drawing was the equipment and how it was connected, so 
                those details were abstracted with simple straight lines drawn between them.

                By extension offices in another building, or remote branch offices might all
                need to be part of the same logical network but part of those "straight line"
                connections, might require connecting over a wide-area-network (WAN) or across
                the internet itself, which is also an abstraction of protocols and various
                hardware and transmedia.

                Rather than worry about the details of the telephone lines and fiber-optic 
                cables and communications switching companies and service providers, which 
                are indeed <em>important</em>, they are abstracted, meaning the complexities
                have been left off and a big cover thrown over it and all of those details 
                were wrapped up in a big mysterious ball that was illustrated in the form
                of a line drawing of a raincloud. It was understood that there was a lot of
                important detail and <em>stuff</em> going on in there, but it was not relevant
                to the purpose for the drawing.
