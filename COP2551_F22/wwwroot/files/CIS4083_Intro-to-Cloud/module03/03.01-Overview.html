            </p>
            <p>
                When my wife and I moved to our first house, it was quite an adventure.
                The house was in rough condition and in need of a complete overhaul.
                It was what we could (almost) afford.Over the next years and
                living in it while we remodeled, we made it into a home. We've since
                sold that house and moved to another.
            </p>
            <p>
                Moving from an apartment to a house, came with new expenses. On top of
                our mortgage with the bank, we had to set up utility accounts to establish
                water and electricity and gas, in addition to homeowners insurance and
                even trash pickup in the city where we lived.
            </p>
            <p>
                We had been married just a few years, just finished and finishing school,
                had babies on the way, the budget was tight, and now we had taken on
                the care and feeding of a house.
            </p>
            <p>
                Many of our expenses were fixed. The costs of construction materials
                was a variable we had some control over and some projects had to be
                delayed along the way. There were opportunities for extra money to
                be made at work from time to time and we took them as they came.
            </p>
            <p>

                     alt="close the refrigerator door" width="200" />
            </p>
            <p>
                I'm sure this story is familiar to many of you. Sometimes money is
                tighter than usual, or unexpected costs come along and you take a
                look at the expenses you can control and those that you can't, and
                take steps to reduce expenses. Growing up, we were reminded to turn
                off lights when you weren't in the room, not to leave the refrigerator
                door open, and only running the heat or air conditioner when it was
                absolutely necessary.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3>Cloud Services</h3>
            <p>
                This story is meant to serve as a caution and a reminder. Lights and
                heat and electricity are important to have in the house, but those
                are expenses I can predict and control with usage limits.
            </p>
            <p>
                Cloud computing offers benefits that you may only start to realize
                but they also come with expenses that you can predict and control
                with usage limits.
            </p>
            <p>
                In the last module, you recognized that there are several cloud
                service providers to choose from globally, but by market share,
                three currently stand out from the rest.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <h3>Controlling and Avoiding Costs</h3>
            <p>
                Among my goals for this class, for you to see and use common
                cloud services on these popular service providers, and for you
                to be familiar with all three and with what can be accomplished.
            </p>
            <p>
                As an introduction, there isn't time to become experts or to
                <i>deep-dive</i> any of these in this course, but it is my
                intent, through experience, that you will feel empowered to
                investigate more on your own and not be hesitant to use these
                and others to support your own projects in the future.
            </p>
            <p>
                By signing up for these services, you will be assuming some
                risk, but it will be your responsibility to control costs and
                limit expenses. The exercises and activities for this class
                will intentionally be designed to keep costs at or near $0,
                a precedent demonstrated with my textbook selection.
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p class="ic-flash-info">
                Be careful, not fearful!
            </p>
            <p>&nbsp;</p>
            <p>
                For comparison, I have had active accounts with all three of
                these vendors for close to three years. I have active web
                applications running and often run demonstrations and tests
                on these accounts and have only incurred small costs once.
            </p>
            <p>
                For a period of about 3 months, I delayed the purchase of
                a dedicated development PC when I was beginning a project.
                I opted instead to create and run a Windows virtual machine
                (VM) and installed my development tools onto it. It served
                the temporary need very well. On most days, I stopped the
                process at the end of my workday, and only started it up
                when I needed it, but there were many times when it ran for
                days at a time. I monitored my expenses and scaled the machine
                up and down to match the performance I needed for the project.
                My cost incurred for this Azure VM was approximately $10/month
                for those three months before I completed the project,
                archived my code and deleted the machine. Later, when the
                project picked up again, I was prepared to purchase another
                PC for the task, but I had no regrets for the small cost I
                had incurred during that development time.
            </p>
            <p>
                I do have other web applications and small database applications
                that I have running on cloud services, but these were built
                for small projects and are kept within the free-tier.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you run an exercise that creates and deploys a resource
                with an estimated cost of $13/month, and you run it for an
                hour, then the cost incurred should be about $13/mo / 30 days
                / 24 hours or about $0.02.  Even if you use it for a few hours,
                you will probably remain well below the billable threshold in most
                cases.
            </p>
            <p>
                The point I want you to take away from this is to feel
                comfortable building and testing concepts and projects on
                this emerging global cloud environment, but remember that
                you are able to control the costs incurred.
