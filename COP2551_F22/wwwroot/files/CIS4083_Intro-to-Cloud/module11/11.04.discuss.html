            <em>The future's so bright, you gotta wear shades!</em>
            -- <strong>Timbuk 3</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            A colleague of mine shared some statistics at the beginning of this semester which
            indicated surprisingly (to me) pessimistic student hope for the future.
        </p>
        <p>
            When I look back at my own experience at or near the end of my undergraduate studies,
            I remember feeling apprehension and uncertainty for what was to come, so it really
            shouldn't have been all that surprising.
        </p>
        <p>
            In my case, I was recently married, my wife and I were both launching into our new
            life with brand new college degrees, no clear paths for careers, and a pretty good 
            network of similarly unemployed and under-employed friends.
        </p>
        <p>
            The world was politically unstable, global military threats were growing, nationwide
            health crises and looming declarations of war were nightly news, unemployment was
            rising, economic recession was reality, housing costs were at all-time crisis levels,
            and we had very little idea of what was next.
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>Sound familiar?</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            These observations could have been in the 40s, the 60s, the 80s, or just about any time
            since then, including today. So none of these statistics and observations should have
            surprised me. Perhaps I had simply forgotten.
        </p>
        <p>
            We were able to get jobs to (just) pay the bills, we continued to expand our circle
            of friends, and we jumped (for better or worse) when the (lucky) breaks came our way.
            We weren't particularly patient or hope-filled, but we just kept going and made
            decisions along the way that we hoped were right, or at least not too wrong. You know,
            <em>living</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            Along the way was a series of experiences and decisions and occurrences that all added
            up to be a terrific story, but one we could not have planned and could not have
            predicted.

            This week, I want to share three more perspectives for you to consider and compare. All
            three of these were recorded about ten years ago, prior to the global Covid-19 pandemic
            and all have a common optistic view of possibilities, and somewhere in here, maybe is
            the key to the question, <strong>What's next?</strong>

            <strong>Marco Annunziata</strong> is an economist who discusses what he calls a
            <em>metamorphic change.</em> and the age of the industrial internet.
        </p>
        <p>
            According to his hypotheses, what will be the impact on jobs as a result?

            Carl Bass from Autodesk references the power of <em>Infinite Computing</em> as a factor in
            modern technical advances with specific references. He challenges some of the traditional
            limitations of having large teams of support and access to investment capital, and in contrast,
            emphasizes diversity and mindset.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is consistent with one of my favorite depictions of <em>diversity</em>, specifically,
            the collaboration of dissimilar perspectives and sharing of ideas from different backgrounds.
        </p>
        <p>
            With the topics we have explored, using cloud resources to support computing tasks,
            virtualization of compute platforms and networks, access to data without practical limits,
            data analytics, sensors and control systems, management, and even collaboration with human
            resources, from both an historic and current-state perspective, do you agree with the notion
            that we have unprecedented access to <em>infinite computing</em>? What, if any are the
            limitations?  Is this trending in one direction or another?

            Along the subject of <em>what is possible</em>, Peter Diamandis provides statistics which counter the
            popular media emphasis on the negative. It is a message of optimism and a reminder that the next
            life-saving, hope-giving, community-changing, fortune-making ideas are all around us and their
            source is within reach. This message was delivered ten years ago, but he asserts that technology
            and capabilities are continuing to increase at a trajectory consistent with Moore's Law (doubling
            every 12 to 24 months).
        </p>
        <p>
            Rather than dismissing the very real problems facing society now and throughout history, he presents
            specific approaches to advance toward solutions.

            I will contend that the emmergence of cloud cabilities and global access to limitless 
            technologies is one of the most ground-breaking capbilities of our lifetime. Watch for 
            places that it's making a difference. Ask yourselves what else we can do with it!
        </p>
        <p>
            Watch (listen to) all three of these presentations. Take notes of key points that are
            meaningful to you. I added some questions above, to get you started, but I'm more interested
            in your thoughts and perspectives. Do you agree with these perspectives? Were they short-sighted
            (10 years ago)? Are they still relevant? Do they share a common theme? Did one stand out to
            you over the others?
        </p>
        <p>
            Access to cloud technologies opens possibilities, but possibilities still require innovation.
            Global problems exist and many of them have existed since the dawn of mankind in some form
            or other. Experience shows us time and time again that solutions come incrementally. Amazing
            <em>super-computing</em> power from the 1970s taken out of context would easily be dismissed
            as simplistic compared with the mobile device we all carry everyday. Even the flip-phones
            that you probably had once were once considered technical marvels and obsolete recycling
            problems today. The solutions to tomorrow's problems are no different. They won't come all
            at once, but in small steps. Be watchful for the tiny forward steps, and the <em>limitless</em>
            resources at hand for developing those ideas today.
