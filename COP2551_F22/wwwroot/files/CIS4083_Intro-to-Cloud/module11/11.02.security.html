        <h2 class="alert alert-info">Cloud Services and Security Concerns</h2>

        <p>
            A common concern across businesses moving data and processing from
            locally-hosted and self-managed servers to cloud resources is security.
            There is an inherent level of trust that must exist to move perceived
            control of data processing and storage from hardware that you can touch
            and feel to a remote <em>abstract service</em>.
        </p>
        <p>
            The security of cloud resources versus self-managed servers can vary 
            depending on the specific circumstances and the level of expertise of 
            those managing them. However, in general, cloud resources are considered 
            to be just as secure as or even more secure than self-managed servers.
        </p>
        <p>
            Cloud providers typically have robust security measures in place to 
            protect their customers' data and resources. They typically employ a 
            range of security features such as firewalls, intrusion detection and 
            prevention systems, data encryption, and regular security audits.
        </p>
        <p>
            Most cloud service providers have state-of-the-art data centers; they 
            normally have fire suppression systems, backup power generators, and 
            strong physical security measures in place.
        </p>
        <p>
            Additionally, cloud providers can provide customers with access to a wide 
            range of security tools and features that can help them manage their 
            resources securely. This can include tools for monitoring and managing 
            access to resources, implementing multi-factor authentication, and 
            configuring network security policies.
        </p>
        <p>
            In contrast, self-managed servers can be more vulnerable to security 
            threats if they are not properly secured and maintained. Managing server 
            security requires a high level of expertise and ongoing maintenance to 
            ensure that security measures are up-to-date and effective.
        </p>
        <p>       
            Overall, while both cloud resources and self-managed servers can be made 
            reasonably secure, cloud resources may provide additional security benefits
            due to the expertise and resources of cloud providers. However, it is 
            important to note that each situation is unique, and it is important to 
            assess security needs and risks on a case-by-case basis.

        <h3 class="alert alert-info">Business Applications</h3>
        <p>
            It's easy to see why cloud migration might start with a consideration
            of business needs. An established business should regularly review
            their operating needs and costs. As part of the planning discussions
            and activities, it should be recognized that migration of services
            doesn't have to be an <em>all-at-once</em> process.
        </p>
        <p class="ic-flash-info">
            Start with mapping business needs to cloud service offerings to
            determine which make sense and which are beneficial
        </p>
        <p>
            A large defense contractor reviewing their IT usage requirements
            might choose to move email services away from internally managed
            servers to PaaS services, but may need to delay or take another
            approach to storage given consideration to export control concerns.
            Moving customer and internal proprietary data to cloud resources
            does not always allow for control over where the data is physically
            stored.
        </p>

        <hr />
        <p>
            As time goes by, it becomes more common that building a cloud 
            service foundation does not mean migrating existing infrastructure.
            The cloud service model creates opportunities for startups to create
            new products and services which would not have been possible just a
            few years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
            A small accounting firm that I support was building their business
            and relying on a proprietary software package with a license model
            which allowed it to be installed on only a single CPU. In time, when
            the firm grows, they will reconsider their investment, but in the 
            first year, the three partners, working in separate cities and time
            zones, decided to share scheduled access to a shared virtual machine.
            The VM's capabilities are scaled up during periods when performance
            requirements are at a peak, and scaled back when the VM is used less
            frequently. This resulted in a predictable and reasonable budget 
            impact in their first year of operation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another startup I worked with, needed to provide a complex data 
            integration app which could support thousands of concurrent users
            and share a database with a custom business analysis software package.
            The company created an online presence with continuous integration/
            continuous deployment (CI/CD) product development, six separate 
            database instances, and eventually integrated their accounting and
            billing processes with the online system. Real-time scaling of the
            cloud services enabled the company to predict and control costs
            while maintaining peak usage operations.
        </p>

            Whether migrating existing infrastucture, or building and growing
            new business, cloud services for large and small business are effecting
            very real change in the way that businesses operate.
