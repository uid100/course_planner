        <p>
            According to <a href="https://www.businessleader.co.uk/what-is-a-disruptor/"
                            style="color:navy;">
            Business Leader</a> online, an industry <strong>Disruptor</strong>
            is a service or product which replaces or displaces a conventional
            market practice. Not too long ago, shops in every major city offered
            video tape and eventually disc format movie rentals. These have become
            obsolete. A small niche coffee shop in Seattle took a unique business 
            model to international success. Even takeout from local small restaurants, 
            in more and more cases, have menus and even ordering hosted online. Stop
            for a moment to think about how many things we do every day that have
            replaced <em>the way it used to be.</em>

            In your own words, what are his three theses? Do you agree with them? 
            What are some real-world examples which either support or contradict
            his ideas?
