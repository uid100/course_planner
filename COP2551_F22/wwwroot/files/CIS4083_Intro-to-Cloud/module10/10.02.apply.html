        <h2 class="alert alert-info">Migrating to the cloud: a business perspective</h2>
        <p>
            There is a lot of information on the internet and in literature about
            <em>migrating</em> businesses to the cloud, but what does that mean,
            and how relevant is it?
        </p>
        <p>
            As we have seen, cloud technologies enable off-loading much of the 
            infrastructure, installation, configuration, management and support of
            common computing services.
        </p>
        <p>
            A business which plans to migrate essential functions to cloud services
            needs to consider the policies, procedures, and actions to ensure the 
            availability of critical business functions to employees, customers,
            and other key stakeholders. Interruption to this core <em>business
            continuity</em> could be costly.
        </p>
    <hr />
        <p>
            Migrating a business to the cloud can be a complex and challenging 
            process. The scope and business case will influence the details. The
            process should consider all of these steps.
        </p>
        <ol>
            <li>
                Determine the Business Needs: Start by determining what the business needs from
                the cloud. Identify the business-critical applications and data that need to be 
                migrated and evaluate the required cloud resources, including computing, storage, 
                networking, and security.
            </li>
            <li>
                Choose a Cloud Service Provider: Research and evaluate different cloud service 
                providers to determine which one best meets the business needs. Consider factors 
                such as cost, reliability, security, and scalability. As you have seen, there may
                be a case for using services from more than one service provider. The added management
                of that approach should also be considered in the evaluation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Develop a Migration Plan: Develop a detailed migration plan that outlines the steps 
                and timeline for the migration process. This plan should include a risk management 
                strategy, a communication plan, and a plan for testing and validation.
            </li>
            <li>
                Migrate Data and Applications: Start by migrating non-critical applications and 
                data to the cloud. This will allow the business to test the migration process and 
                identify any potential issues or challenges. Once the non-critical applications 
                and data have been successfully migrated, move on to the critical applications and 
                data. Timing of switching between data sources also need to be carefully planned
                to avoid data loss. Database replication which creates two live copies on separate
                servers should be used. If one database fails, the other can immediately take over
                operations.
            </li>
            <li>
                Test and Validate: After the migration is complete, thoroughly test and validate 
                the applications and data to ensure they are working correctly in the cloud 
                environment.
            </li>
            <li>
                Optimize and Manage: Once the migration is complete, optimize the cloud resources 
                and implement ongoing management and monitoring processes to ensure the cloud 
                environment continues to meet the business needs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Train Staff: Train the staff to effectively use the new cloud environment and 
                the associated tools and services.
            </li>
            <li>
                Monitor and Evaluate: Monitor the cloud environment regularly and evaluate the 
                effectiveness of the migration. Make adjustments as needed to optimize the cloud 
                environment and ensure it continues to meet the business needs.
            </li>
        </ol>

        <p>
            It's easy to see why cloud migration might start with a consideration
            of business needs. An established business should regularly review
            their operating needs and costs. As part of the planning discussions
            and activities, it should be recognized that migration of services
            doesn't have to be an <em>all-at-once</em> process.
        </p>
        <p class="ic-flash-info">
            Start with mapping business needs to cloud service offerings to
            determine which make sense and which are beneficial
        </p>
        <p>
            A large defense contractor reviewing their IT usage requirements
            might choose to move email services away from internally managed
            servers to PaaS services, but may need to delay or take another
            approach to storage given consideration to export control concerns.
            Moving customer and internal proprietary data to cloud resources
            does not always allow for control over where the data is physically
            stored.

        <p>
            As time goes by, it becomes more common that building a cloud 
            service foundation does not mean migrating existing infrastructure.
            The cloud service model creates opportunities for startups to create
            new products and services which would not have been possible just a
            few years ago.
        </p>
        <p>
            A small accounting firm that I support was building their business
            and relying on a proprietary software package with a license model
            which allowed it to be installed on only a single CPU. In time, when
            the firm grows, they will reconsider their investment, but in the 
            first year, the three partners, working in separate cities and time
            zones, decided to share scheduled access to a shared virtual machine.
            The VM's capabilities are scaled up during periods when performance
            requirements are at a peak, and scaled back when the VM is used less
            frequently. This resulted in a predictable and reasonable budget 
            impact in their first year of operation.
        </p>
        <p>
            Another startup I worked with, needed to provide a complex data 
            integration app which could support thousands of concurrent users
            and share a database with a custom business analysis software package.
            The company created an online presence with continuous integration/
            continuous deployment (CI/CD) product development, six separate 
            database instances, and eventually integrated their accounting and
            billing processes with the online system. Real-time scaling of the
            cloud services enabled the company to predict and control costs
            while maintaining peak usage operations.
        </p>

        <p>
            Whether migrating existing infrastucture, or building and growing
            new business, cloud services for large and small business are effecting
            very real change in the way that businesses operate.
