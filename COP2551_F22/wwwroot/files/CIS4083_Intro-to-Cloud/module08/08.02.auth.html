                    The cashier at the corner store is required to confirm your government-issued

                All of these are intended to legitimately and conscientiously <em>discriminate</em>

                Additionally, if you are building or managing an online application or system,
                it is likely that there are some activities that only specific users should be
                allowed to access.
            </p>
            <p>
                But in order to control this gate or filter to allow some users in and keeping
                others out, you need a way to identify them.

            <h3 class="alert">Authorization</h3>
            <p>
                Allowing and disallowing user permissions may be granted at the individual or 
                group (role) level. Granting a particular user all of the permissions they may 
                require for a particular job can be tedious in large organizations, so it's 
                often easier to assign them to a particular role that has a permission.
            </p>
            <p>
                All users should be able to access their own messages, but not messages intended
                for others. Elevated permissions are usually granted to system administrators,
                who may need to add and delete users and roles.
            </p>

        <div id="identity" style="padding:20px">
            <h3 class="alert">Authentication</h3>
            <div id="how-do-we-know">
                <h3>How do I know it's you?</h3>
                <p>
                    Authentication, if not <em>most</em> important, becomes very important. This is not
                    a new concept for application development, but you might be surprised at how the
                    solutions and performance expectations have changed over the years.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The question eventually becomes how to implement user authentication.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Once upon a time, it was enough to prompt the user and ask for their username.
                    (<em>Ok. Hi Bob. Welcome Back.</em>) If the user had physical access to the system,
                    it must be ok, and all I really care about is what their name is, so I know how
                    to greet them and where to find <em>their</em> files.
                </p>
                <p>
                    That was adequate until it wasn't. Next the application would ask for a password
                    and the application would store the password. In time, this became bad practice
                    too.
                </p>
                <p>
                    How many passwords do we need to manage now? If we are using strong encryption to
                    manage and encrypt store and recover passwords, there are many points of failure
                    and overhead and risk.
                </p>
                <p>
                    In most cases, I don't need to know anything about you except to recognize you
                    when you return. I likely don't need to know anything about the user, except
                    that they were here before and that someone else isn't pretending to be them.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Software libraries were written to help with this, and we could build databases and
                    support methods, but the result is reinventing a wheel which is probably already
                    obsolete.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Federated passwords and IDaaS is a much better solution.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Perhaps not 5 years ago, but by now, most of us are familiar with Single Sign-On 
                    (SSO) and multi-factor authentication (MFA).
                </p>
                <p>
                    When you visit sites that invite you to login using Facebook or Google or
                    Microsoft, they very likely do not care about your Facebook or Google or
                    Microsoft accounts, they are simply using them as a trusted authority to validate
                    the claim that you are who you say your are. When you log in <em>through</em>
                    these systems, they will issue a credential to you and <em>vouch</em> for you
                    to the requesting system. They don't share any other information other than
                    "yes, I know this user."
                </p>
                <p>
                    As developers, we probably don't care
                    about where a user had dinner or which memes they LOL-d. All we care about is
                    that a trusted authority said, "yeah, he is who he claims to be. (Because I
                    said so.)"

                <p>
                    To understand the process of user authentication, it helps to look at the evolution.
                    From installing password files on every system, and adding two-factor authentication
                    (2FA or MFA), and enterprise domain providers, SSO, and federated identity systems.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This series, although a couple years old now, provides an excellent introduction
                    to implementing Identity in your code. The later sessions deal with some specifics
                    about using MS-Identity in a .NET application, but the fundamentals are worth
                    your time.

                    These episodes are a little long (~60min). The first is interesting and explains a
                    little about the problem. Here is the link, but consider skipping right to episode 2 
                    (of 9!) linked below, to learn more about the history and current state of user 
                    authentication and how we got where we are.

                    <strong>Spoiler alert:</strong> the takeaway from this series, is not to help you
                    learn how to implement user authentication, but to convince you not to write a
                    home-grown solution. (see Episode 3)

                    In episode 2, the hosts go further into the technical approach
                    to the problem, still at a high level and explaining the differences between impersonation
                    and selected delegation with (Open Authorization - OAuth2.0) and finally a discription
                    of OpenID Connect. More than just a walk-through of how to integrate these standards,
                    this discussion presents a good explanation of the what, why, and how. Even just as a
                    casual user of modern web applications, this is a helpful discussion of the state
                    of the industry how to do authentication in modern applications.

                    To make a long story short(er), authentication is hard, but necessary. <em>Outsourcing</em>
                    this to external service dependencies makes for more robust systems and a better user experience.

                    In the first couple of minutes of this video (5:33), Jeff Hainsworth provides a clear description 
                    of federated authentication, which is a specialized case of single sign-on (SSO), what it is
                    and how it works.
