                    As a software architect or systems IT professional, what is <em>wrong</em> 
                    with utilizing a simple username:password database?
                </li>
                <li>
                    Think about the passwords that you need to track. Do you have a password 
                    management strategy? Has your strategy changed over recent years? Should it?
                </li>
                <li>
                    I assume that most (non-technical) people do not have a good understanding
                    of how federated authentication works, and many have a general distrust of
                    logging in to an outside system for user authentication. What do you like
                    or dislike about the user experience (UX) of using federated authentication?
                    After viewing the provided videos and resources, do you have a better 
                    understanding of it, and what would you tell your non-technical friends about 
                    the process?
