            Commonly projects begin with customer discussions and problem
            analysis prior to developing a solution. This is known as 
            <strong>capturing originating requirements</strong>.

        <h4>Background</h4>
        <p>
            I keep several of my guitars and other musical instruments in one 
            room of my house, many of which are sensitive to environmental
            changes. Wood furniture may react to changes in temperature and
            humidity, but those same changes can have a more profound effect
            on wooden instruments such as guitars. If the humidity is too low, 
            the wood of the guitar can become dry and brittle, leading to cracks 
            and other damage. If the humidity is too high, the wood can absorb 
            moisture, causing swelling, warping, and other types of damage.
        </p>
        <p>
            In an attempt to monitor and moderate this, I have <strong>temperature 
            and humidity sensors</strong> located around the room.
        </p>
        <p>
            To augment the sensors, I can remotely control the temperature (heating 
            and cooling), <strong>fans</strong> for air circulation, and 
            <strong>humidifiers</strong> to regulate the dry air from running the 
            heater or from certain weather events. This can be a problem year-round 
            and especially in the winter. I live in a relatively dry climate so 
            excessive humidity is not a concern. There isn't a need for a de-humidifier.
        </p>
        <hr />
        <h4>System Description</h4>
        <p>
            I need a cloud-hosted service which will continually monitor multiple IOT
            sensors in the studio, store and analyze the data, and control power (on/off) 
            switches for the fans and humidifiers in the room.
        </p>
        <p>
            I would like to see how the temperature and humidity changes over a period 
            of hours, days, weeks, and months both graphically and as tables of data.
        </p>
        <p>
            An (IOT) thermostat and HVAC should maintain the room temperature
            between 68 and 75 degrees (Fahrenheit) on its own, but the monitoring
            system should allow me to set threshold values to alert me if the
            temperature goes above or below set limits, in which case
            intervention might be necessary. The proposed solution does not need to
            control the temperature, just monitor, store and provide (email) alerts.
        </p>
        <p>
            While the room temperature is controlled by the home's heating and
            air-conditioning (HVAC) system, and monitored by our software, the 
            system needs to turn the humidifier on or off to maintain the relative
            humidity between 45% and 55% along with the fans to circulate the air.
            The system should email alerts if the humidity values exceed user-set 
            limits. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The system should perform periodic system checks and send alerts if the 
            monitors are offline or not reporting regularly. Observation data should 
            be recorded approximately every 5 minutes, and an alert should be sent
            if the system has not responded after 15 minutes.
        </p>
        <p>
            I should be able to view this information and control the user-defined
            thresholds and alert settings from my a web page on my computer and also 
            from a mobile device.
        </p>
        <p>
            An API connecting to a database and serving as the data access layer would 
            make the system extensible and would enable different apps to use the data
            including web and mobile apps.
        </p>

        <h3 class="alert alert-info">Instructions</h3>
        <p>
            Design and describe an n-tier architecture solution for the monitor and 
            control system. The system does not need to be implemented. No coding is
            required for this assignment.
        </p>
        <p>
            The design should include a table of requirements, and a list and description
            of the system components. These <em>could include</em> a database, an API web 
            service, front-end web and mobile application service(s), IOT sensor and 
            controller apps.
        </p>
        <p>
            Look at the different cloud-hosting services and recommend a hosting strategy.
            Which pieces will run on which service? Is the proposed solution scalable to 
            manage costs?
        </p>
        <p>
            The deliverable will be a 2-4 page document and may include diagrams if
            they're appropriate or helpful to describe the solution.
