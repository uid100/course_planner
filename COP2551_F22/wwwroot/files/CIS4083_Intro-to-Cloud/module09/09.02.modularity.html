        <h3 class="alert alert-info">Separation of Concerns</h3>
        <p>
            Multi-layer, and <em>n-Tiered</em> design patterns are important 
            in solution development and especially cloud computing.
        </p>
        <p>
            Layers are used describe the logical separation of functionality,
            for instance the front end or <em>presentation</em> layer from the 
            <em>business</em> logic, and the <em>data access</em> layer(s).
            Closely related to that is distributing those functional layers to
            phyisically separate components, such as a web server, api server, 
            and database server.
        </p>
        <p>
            To use the cake analogy, cakes may have layers inside them, and
            multiple individual cakes can be stacked in separate tiers.

            As a student, so often the point of an assignment is to learn a 
            particular design pattern or architecture, to the point that you 
            may be led to think <em>that</em> is the way to do things.

        <h3 class="alert alert-info">Service-Oriented Architecture</h3>
        <p>
            While not strictly the same as an <em>n-Tiered</em> application which
            has logical boundaries between process blocks, <strong>Service-Oriented
            Architecture (SOA)</strong> operates on a similar concept of decomposing
            individual actions and components to independent services. The concept of
            application layers, and tiers is similar but SOA uses self-contained services
            which may be shared among more than one external application. 
        </p>
        <p>
            A web application may store data in a SQL database running on a cloud server,
            and a separate mobile application may also access that same database, while
            an administrator is accessing the database and running queries from an RDBMS
            client on the server at the same time. Although each appication interacts with
            and relies on the database, the service itself is likely unaware of other 
            processes and applications accessing it.
        </p>
        <p>
            Advantages of running applications across multiple <rm>tiers</rm> or even
            discrete <em>services</em>, includes the ability to scale each component and
            even use <em>load-balancing</em> to share the processing across multiple 
            resources.
