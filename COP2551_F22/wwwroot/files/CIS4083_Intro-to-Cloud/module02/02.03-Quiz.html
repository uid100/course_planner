                Often, system engineers have a need for either physical or logical network diagrams
                either for describing existing infrastructure, or designing new capabilities.
            </p>
            <p>
                Typically, these diagrams are representations, or abstractions. In other words they
                are useful to record and communicate important elements and mask less relevant
                details.
            </p>

                In this example, it is likely that there are various ethernet cables, perhaps
                terminated and plugged into wall outlets, connecting to wires led through the
                building and led to closets with punch-down panels and patch cables, but the
                data relevant to the drawing was the equipment and how it was connected, so
                those details were abstracted with simple straight lines drawn between them.
            </p>
            <p>
                By extension offices in another building, or remote branch offices might all
                need to be part of the same logical network but part of those "straight line"
                connections, might require connecting over a wide-area-network (WAN) or across
                the internet itself, which is also an abstraction of protocols and various
                hardware and transmedia.
            </p>
            <p>
                Rather than worry about the details of the telephone lines and fiber-optic
                cables and communications switching companies and service providers, which
                are indeed <em>important</em>, they are abstracted, meaning the complexities
                have been left off and a big cover thrown over it and all of those details
                were wrapped up in a big mysterious ball that was illustrated in the form
                of a line drawing of a raincloud. It was understood that there was a lot of
                important detail and <em>stuff</em> going on in there, but it was not relevant
                to the purpose for the drawing.

            This image of a cloud was in common use as an abstraction for all the detail
            that was between points of interest. Sometimes that included telecom switches
            and routers and firewalls, and over time, this concept also included servers
            and <em>services</em> that were beyond the scope of the local diagram.
        </p>
        <p>
            So this "Cloud" <strong>abstraction</strong> became more than just the 
            communications link but with the addition of servers, it is also 
            the computing capabilities that is available on the internet. An 
            abstraction is just a way of describing a complex idea in simpler 
            terms.

        <p>
            Let&#39;s talk about what a <strong>server</strong> is.
        </p>
        <p>
            There are many definitions and contexts. Computer hardware that is
            designed to be accessed by multiple concurrent users and operate for
            long periods of time without interuption usually has optimized power
            supplies and cooling capabilities and maybe extra network interfaces.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes it is the computer hardware that we think of as a server.
            Sometimes it is the <em>services</em> running on the computer.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is <em>my</em> definition.
        </p>
        <p class="ic-flash-info">
            A <strong>server</strong> is a process which delivers an expected,
            correct response from a well-formed request.
        </p>
        <p>
            A browser asks a web server for a page. A customer can order cup
            of coffee in a coffee shop. A vending machine may sell candy bars.
            By this definition, all of these are servers.
        </p>
        <p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;"

        <p>
            Do you agree with my definition of a <strong>server</strong>?

        <h3 class="alert"><em>Internet Services?</em></h3>
        <p>
            Again, a little history is helpful. The internet introduced a collection
            of useful network protocols which proved to be valuable enough that many
            people and organizations rushed to purchase computer hardware to add to 
            the growing network to participate. They used email and stored files and
            accessed web pages.
        </p>
        <p>
            Access was limited and the content was growing, but obviously it was not 
            the capabilities that we take for granted today.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you had a business at that time, there was a perception of 
            <em>legitimacy</em> if you had an actual web page. Some Internet Service 
            Providers (ISPs) had servers to host your pages, but most just provided
            routing access and registered domain names had to be applied for.
        </p>
        <p>
            If your company needed a web site, the most likely solution was to add 
            <em>servers</em> (computer hardware) to the dedicated server room alongside 
            their file servers and add to their team of IT professionals to find their
            way through. This was an expensive proposition.
        </p>
        <p>
            Just as the technology was changing, a new industry was born. The idea
            was more about the business solution than the technology. Businesses
            needed internet services without the added expense of purchasing more 
            equipment and hiring more staff to run it. So the cloud was born.
        </p>
        <p>
            It was actually the collapse of this explosive growth that led to this
            new industry. When the famed rapid growth of the so-called DotCom industry
            came to an abrupt end, as usually happens with unsustainable growth, 
            companies still had a need for the new technologies and other companies
            finding themselves with computing power which exceeded their needs, developed 
            a way to lease those computing services to others.
        </p>
        <p>
            In much the same way that we pay the power company to provide gas and 
            electricity to our homes, we could now piggy-back on one of these 
            company&#39;s internet servers instead of installing our own.
