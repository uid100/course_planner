                At the end of this module, you should be able to explain and give examples of
                cloud service types and distinguish SaaS, IaaS, and PaaS.

        <h3><em>Why?</em></h3>
        <p>
            In the last module, we talked about what the cloud is an about the concept of
            outsourcing common services to third parties.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you needed to fly from New York City to London, you probably would not start
            by building a plane and hiring someone to fly it, instead you could identify
            one of several passenger air carriers which provide that service and buy a ticket
            to fly on one of their airplanes.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you then needed to go on to Paris or Frankfurt, you could simply buy another 
            ticket and fly there.
        </p>
        <p>
            To extend the metaphor, if you needed to fly your entire team to another city, 
            you would have the option of chartering an entire plane to take them on that 
            flight. But you only pay for the flights that you need, and you rely on the 
            flight crew to fly the plane and the ground crew to keep up with maintenance
            and fuel and other operations of airplane and airline management.
        </p>
        <p>
            Likewise, if you need more computing power, you can simply configure your cloud 
            services to deliver more capability for the time that you need it and turn it 
            off when the project ends.

            In this course, we will leverage resources from the industry and dive into 
            real-world situations and apply real-world solutions. The intent is to form 
            a good understanding of the cloud in general terms, as an architecture and 
            business model and systems solution. In the course of exploring hands-on 
            examples, you will see differences in the way things are accomplished from
            one provider to the next and even how they are named, but try to identify the 
            similarities in the services and the architectures.
