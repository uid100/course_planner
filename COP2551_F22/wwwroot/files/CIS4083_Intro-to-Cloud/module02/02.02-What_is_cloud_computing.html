            At the top of several of the previous course pages, I have included <em>a</em>
            definition of Cloud Computing. Without referring back to it, can you remember
            what it said?
        </p>

        <p class="ic-flash-info"
           title="Cloud Computing is the on-demand delivery of compute power, database, storage, applications, and other IT resources via the internet with pay-as-you-go pricing.">
            <strong>Cloud Computing</strong> is ...<br /><br />
        </p>

            You can hover over the box above to see the answer.
        </p>

        <p>
            This definition describes highly available delivery of IT services. In the last module,
            I included a video in which included a discussion of cloud computing services in terms
            of three layers, Software, Infrastructure and Platform. If you skipped over this, or
            just want to watch it again (6 minutes) it is repeated below.
        </p>

            These <em>layers</em> commonly map to <em>service types</em> or categories.
            Specifically Infrastructure-as-a-Service (IaaS), Software-as-a-Service (SaaS), 
            Platform-as-a-Service (PaaS). Sometimes, collectively these cloud computing
            services are referred to as Anything-as-a-Service and abbreviated (XaaS).

        <h3 class="alert">AWS: Types of Cloud Computing</h3>
        <p>
            Amazon Web Services (AWS) differentiates these as <em>Cloud Computing Models.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/">here</a>
            (https://aws.amazon.com/types-of-cloud-computing/) is a brief description.
        </p>
        <p>
            &nbsp;
        </p>
        <em>Why is this important?</em>
        <p>
            Understanding the different service models will drive engineering solution
            and architecture decisions. The different models are similar to the differences
            between a renting a car, riding on a transit bus, or using a ride-sharing 
            service. All three solutions will carry a passenger from point to point,
            but all three have different planning and operational decisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            With a rental car, you will need to be capable of operating the vehicle in the 
            intended environment, and while your maintenance costs are minimal operating
            costs such as gas, tolls, and parking are your responsibility.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using a city bus, you can join a planned route at particular points and ride
            between stops, but you will need to have knowledge of the route and any
            required transfers. The cost of usage is very low but the flexibility of 
            destinations in most cases will be the most limited.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ride-share services have gained popularity in recent years and are available
            in major cities worldwide. With this option, the user has great flexibility
            to specify origin and destination, the user avoids all maintenance and 
            operating costs and in many cases may have less flexibility than the rental
            car, but for short distances, this can be a very affordable option.
        </p>
        <p>
            Likewise, if your engineering solution requires a global internet available
            web application which relies on business data managed and stored in a database
            with access limited to authorized users then the solution might include building
            a database on a cloud-based database (PaaS) server, hosting a web application 
            as another one or more web application or Application Programming
            Interface (API) (PaaS) services, and integrating with in Identification-as-a-Service
            (IDaaS) run by another provider as a Software-as-a-Service (SaaS). This multi-tiered
            solution may be running on the same or multiple cloud providers such as AWS or
            Microsoft Azure.
        </p>
        <p>
            Alternatively, the same solution could involve employing a cloud-based virtual 
            machine (vm) and installing and configuring database software, a web server, and
            writing software to authenticate user with password encryption and multi-factor
            authentication stored in a separate database. Using this Infrastructure-as-a-Service
            (IaaS) will give the engineering team the most control over every aspect of the 
            installation, but require the most responsibility for ensuring all of the applications
            are patched to acceptable security levels and that all of the individual software
            licenses are maintained.
