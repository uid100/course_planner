<p>I'm Dan. This is me. Ok, this was me about ten years ago. My hair's grayer, eyesight worse, clothes are tighter, but my beautiful wife likes this picture.</p>
<hr />
<p>I'm excited about this course. The topic and the technology is emerging. My intent is to keep the information fresh. Together, we'll have some extra work to do.</p>
<p>Often "<em>introduction to--"</em> courses consist of reading through a thoughtfully selected textbook, designed to describe a topic and perhaps invite the reader to try some simplified examples to apply the principles as their presented. This is a typical and appropriate approach to learning a new skill or gathering information about a subject.</p>
<p>In this course, we have made the conscious decision to take another approach. There will be outside content to read, or view and consider, but more importantly, we will consider the cloud and cloud technologies from an engineering and business impact from a much more hands-on perspective.</p>
<p>The tools we will employ and explore are <em>literally</em> online, so that is where we will go for information about them.</p>
<hr />
<p>Speaking of&nbsp;<em>online,&nbsp;</em>the college lists this as a&nbsp;<em>web</em> course. You'll also hear it referred to as&nbsp;<em>asynchronous.</em> We won't have scheduled meetings, but we do have a class schedule to accomplish. The Canvas course is designed to guide you through it, but we'll do it together, and I will make an effort to not let you feel alone through the process.</p>
<hr />
<p>What to do next?</p>
<p>Find the course from your Canvas dashboard linked from the college website. Read through the front page material and take a look at the links that are there. I've tried to set it up so that all of the logical navigation links that you'll want are there. You can find out more about me, about the course, read the syllabus (there's a lot there) and then go to the first module and start reading the content.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>I have scheduled times during the week when you can easily find me online. Please note that I travel often, but all of the times listed in the course are local time at Santa Fe College (EST).&nbsp;</p>
<p>Dan</p>
