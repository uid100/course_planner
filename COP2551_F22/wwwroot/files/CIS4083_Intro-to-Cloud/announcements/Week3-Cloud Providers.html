<h2>The Big Three </h2>
<h3>Print vs Online Media</h3>
<p>
    I will preface this by humbly admitting that I have never written a book.
    I suppose I've co-authored papers in technical journals, but that's actually
    a stretch too. I worked in research labs and have been named as a contributor 
    for papers and projects where I collected and processed data and helped with 
    editing, but really I had very little to do with them.
</p>
<p>
    Anyway, for discussion, this is only based on speculation and limited 
    observation, I believe that if I sat down to author a textbook, developed 
    and illustrated the content, went through more than a few back-and-forth 
    cycleswith editors and peer reviews, when my textbook finally gets to first 
    printing, and selected for classroom use by an instructor, and ordered by 
    the school's bookstore, and purchased by the first group of students, and 
    whatever other hoops have been cleared, considerable time has passed from 
    when the content was first created and first consumed by the reader. In many, 
    and in fact most cases, this is not a bad thing. I suspect that not a lot 
    has changed in basic Calculus or Byzantine history, although perhaps new 
    perspectives and teaching approaches warrant new textbooks.
</p>
<p>
    I am certainly not against textbooks. I have many, some are excellent, and 
    I'm grateful to the subject matter experts who took the time to organize 
    concepts and shared them in print.
</p>
<p>
    Recency is a point on the plus side of internet search, but of course it 
    also carries the risk of unverified sources. As you know, <em>you can't 
    believe everything you read.</em>
</p>
<p>
    I just finished reading through your exploration of the current state of 
    cloud service providers and I was encouraged that one thing that you discovered 
    in this changing landscape, is that there is in fact, change.
</p>
<p>
    I was very happy to read your discussions and to see you taking a critical 
    interest in not just what your findings are, but also the sources. I hope 
    that you found it as interesting as I did.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Amazon Web Services</h3>
<p>
    Yes, I've written in your Canvas notes some information about how they 
    arrived and not just that they are currently the largest player in the 
    market, and also the first, but in my opinion, why. I invite you to research 
    the background on many of these and form your own opinions.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<h3>Microsoft Azure</h3>
<p>
    Some of you looked at available data and found that, while <strong>MS</strong> 
    has been in this #2 seat for a while, they have been closing the gap between 
    them and AWS in recent years. In sports and in business, you know that the 
    change in relative position and the rate of change is as important as the
    position. It's good that your horse is in front, but do you see how fast the 
    next horse is catching up? Microsoft has been investing in, and growing their 
    cloud infrastructure, as well as their marketing. It is not surprising that 
    they are positioned as well as they are.
</p>
<p>
    On a side note, although I am trying to present a level field and honest 
    comparison, I do have more professional cloud experience with Microsoft 
    than the others, including for clients and personal use.
</p>

<h3>The "others"</h3>
<p>
    Having seen the discrepancy in market-share between the top 2 and perhaps 3,
    the plan to have you look at the nominal top 10 was deliberate. I will call 
    this nominal because it was hardly scientific or even heavily statistical. 
    Still, your survey(s) pointed out some interesting findings.
</p>
<p>
    I knew that using just about any source, the top 3 would be clear. It may 
    surprise you to hear that when I conducted this same survey 5 years ago, 
    it was <strong>IBM</strong> in the number 3 position. But there was more to 
    discover in these other major providers.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    <strong>Alibaba</strong> is one of the largest import/export, e-commerce, and 
    banking companies in the world, to have such a strong footprint in this market 
    is no surprise, I would have expected to see them ranked higher. There were 
    big corrections in the global economy last 2 years when China began making
    efforts to break up some of the large monopolies, and stock prices fell. It 
    would not surprise me to see them recover and grow faster in coming years.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Google Cloud</strong> also isn't too big a surprise, but again the 
    change in market share is more interesting than the standing, having been a 
    relatively smaller presence in the past, it is now a main focal point for 
    parent company <strong>Alphabet</strong>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Yes, there are many players, large and small. We will be looking more at the
    fundamental technologies and architectures of the generic cloud, but now that 
    we have established these <em>big 3</em> as the industry leaders, that is where 
    we will focus.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    This week's hands-on activity is to create accounts for <strong>AWS</strong> 
    and <strong>Azure</strong>. In order to build and test and deploy solutions, 
    you will need to have accounts on these platforms. I had planned to provide 
    you with click-by-click notes on doing this, but now I suspect that may be 
    unnecessary. As you'll read in this week's notes, I have accounts on the 
    top 3 and actively use them, but it has been a long while since I set those 
    up.
</p>
<p>
    What I'd like to have you do, instead of reading my "click-here, then click-here" 
    instructions, is to dive in and discover how difficult or intuitive the process is. 
    If you do run into any steps which raise questions, share them on Discord and see 
    what others have to say. I will also be checking in regularly to join in the 
    discussion and offer some tips.
