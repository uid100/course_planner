                CS-119 is an is an introductory course in program design and development
                using Java or another object oriented programming language to serve as a
                foundation for more advanced programming, computer science or networking
                courses.
            </dd>
            <dd>
                This class emphasizes the development of problem-solving skills as it
                introduces students to computer science through the use of a modern
                object-oriented programming language. Devotes attention to the development
                of effective software engineering practices emphasizing such principles
                as design decomposition, encapsulation, procedural abstraction, testing
                and software reuse.
            </dd>
            <dd>
                Students will learn and apply standard programming constructs,
                problem-solving strategies, the concept of an algorithm, fundamental
                data structures, and the machine representation of data, introductory
                graphics and networking.

                The CS-119L lab section provides tutorials, lab exercises and programming
                projects intended to reinforce the programming and design concepts taught
                in the CS-119 section. Note that CS-119/CS-119L will be taught effectively
                as one course. Enrollment in CS-119L as a co-requisite is mandatory!
            </dd>
            <dd>
                Beyond the need to be registered for both sections, these will be tightly
                integrated and be treated as a singal course. There will be only one course
                in Canvas and the grade earned will be the recorded for 'both' courses.
            </dd>
            <dd>
                College policy requires me to drop students not enrolled in both sections!

                Completion of CIS-110 or a comparable introductory computer course is
                recommended. Students should be comfortable working with Microsoft
                Windows (10 or 11) or the MacOS (10+), using a web browser,
                uploading/downloading files, installing software and using Microsoft
                applications such as Word, Excel and Access.

            <dd>
                Upon completion of the course, the student is expected to demonstrate
                practical applications of software engineering methodologies and
                practices as outlined below:
                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Decompose problems and design program solutions using flowcharts,
                        pseudocode, models, or other tools.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Properly code applications using the fundamental coding structures:
                        sequence, selection, and loops.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Test and debug applications using debugging tools such as trace
                        execution.

                I will be using the Canvas Course Management system for class activities.
                You will be provided a login account once you are officially registered
                for the class. In addition to participating in online discussions, taking
                exams online and submitting labs online, I will provide various learning
                resources such as PowerPoint slides for each chapter, lecture/chapter
                notes, videos and code samples as needed to help you get through the
                chapter material. You are welcome and encouraged to use these learning
                resources in addition to the text material. Please feel free to ask if
                there's a particular code sample or a demonstration video that you need
                that isn't already available. I'm here to help you succeed.

                I will periodically (weekly or bi-weekly) post announcements to the Class
                Announcements page and/or send out e-mails to class members that may
                include things such as class announcements, assignment due dates, exam
                reminders, and answers to frequently asked questions. To ensure that you
                are "kept in the loop", please make sure your e-mail address in Canvas is
                an e-mail account you check on a regular basis.

                This class requires approximately 2 1/2 hours per week of laboratory time.
                Lab exercises and projects are intended to help reinforce the various
                program design and coding concepts being taught in the class. I will try
                to make the assignments "within reason" such that they can be completed
                within the allotted lab period but this may vary depending on the material
                and your prior experience. Due dates for each lab are posted in Canvas with
                the lab assignment. Please check the due date carefully and re-check
                periodically as I may adjust due dates depending on the needs of the class.

                original effort to their assigned portion(s) of a project. Information

                    drop. For short-term classes, the number of acceptable
                    absences is proportionately shorter.<br />
                    Failure to attend the first class meeting may result in the
                    student being dropped from the class.<br />
                    It is the student’s responsibility to officially withdraw
                    from any classes not attended and to discuss anticipated
                    absences with the instructor.
