        <ol>
            <li>
                A web app, also known as a web application, consists of a set of web
                pages that are generated in response to user requests. The Internet
                has many different types of web apps such as search engines, online
                stores, news sites, social sites, music streaming, video streaming,
                and games.
            </li>

                What is the difference between an intranet, the Internet, and the
                cloud.:
                <ol type="a">
                    <li>
                        An intranet is a local area network (LAN) that connects
                        computers that are near each other, usually within the same
                        building or domain.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The Internet is a network that consists of many wide area
                        networks (WANs), and each of those consists of two or more
                        LANs.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The cloud refers to software and services that run on the
                        Internet, instead of locally on your computer. This term
                        implies that you do not have to understand how it works to
                        be able to use it.
                    </li>
                </ol>

            <li>
                A URL consists of the protocol (usually, HTTPS), domain name,
                path, and filename. If you omit the protocol, HTTPS is assumed.
                If you omit the filename, the web server typically looks for a
                file named index.html, index.htm, default.html, or default.htm.

            <li>
                A static web page is stored in a file that contains hard-coded content
                that does not change each time it is requested. This type of web page
                is sent directly from the web server to the web browser when the browser
                requests it.
            </li>
            <li>
                A dynamic web page is a page that&rsquo;s generated by a web app program
                on an application server. This program uses the data that is sent with
                the HTTP request to generate the HTML that is returned to the
                application server.

                pattern.

                The <em>.NET Framework</em>, also known as just <em>.NET</em>, only
                supports the Windows operating system. The <em>.NET Core</em> platform
                is open source and supports multiple operating systems including Windows,
                macOS and Linux.

                Middleware can generate the content for a response, edit the content
                of a request, edit the content of a response, and short circuit a
                request. The Startup.cs file contains the code that configures
                the middleware that is used by the app. This means it builds the
                middleware pipeline for the app.
            </li>
            <li>
                State refers to the current status of the properties, variables, and
                other data maintained by an app for a single user. HTTP is a
                <em>stateless protocol</em>. That means it does not keep track of state
                between round trips. Once a browser makes a request and receives a
                response, the app terminates and its state is lost.
            </li>
            <li>
                Visual Studio Code is a code editor that can be used to develop all
                types of .NET apps, including ASP.NET Core apps. It does not provide
                as many features as an IDE like Visual Studio. A key feature of VS
                Code is that it runs on Windows, macOS, and Linux.
            </li>
            <li>
                NET Core MVC uses a software design paradigm known as <em>
                    convention
                    over configuration
                </em>, or <em>coding by convention</em>. This reduces
                the amount of configuration that developers need to do if they follow
                certain conventions.
            </li>
            <li>
                You typically use C# classes (.cs files) to define controllers and
                models. You typically use Razor views (.cshtml files) to define
                views.
            </li>
            <li>
                The static files for an app can include CSS libraries such as
                Bootstrap or JavaScript libraries such as jQuery. In addition,
                they can include custom CSS or JavaScript files that override
                the code in these libraries.
