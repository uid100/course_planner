        <p>
            In Module 1 you will review the course syllabus and policies. You will become
            familiar with several systems that will be used in this course: Canvas, the
            textbook, several browsers, and the Visual Studio IDE software program.
        </p>
        <p>
            The book that is required for this class is <strong>
                <em>
                    Murach's ASP.NET Core
                    MVC
                </em>
            </strong> by Delemater and Murach. From now on the textbook will
            simply be referred to as the <strong>text</strong>.
        </p>
        <p>
            In this course you will work on files that you download to your own computer
            and you will create your own files from scratch. You will submit your work
            by uploading files to the appropriate Canvas assignment Drop Box.
        </p>

            The goals for this week:
            <ul>
                <li>install and configure Visual Studio (Community Edition)</li>
                <li>start creating applications and using the Visual Studio IDE</li>
            </ul>

    <div id="canvas">
        <h3 class="alert">Canvas </h3>
        <p>
            Canvas is the Learning Management System (LMS) used by Santa Fe College for
            students to communicate online with instructors and other students. It has
            many (many!) different features and each instructor uses it differently. In
            my class you will use:
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>You can reach me through the Canvas email portal. </li>
            <li>
                Use the <span class="strg">Assignment</span> feature to submit
                your homework and lab work. There is a place in each Drop Box for you
                to enter a <span class="strg">comment</span>. Do <strong>not</strong>
                use this space to ask questions about your homework unless you do not
                need the answer until <span class="ital">after</span> the grade is
                posted. <strong>Note:</strong> I don't read these comments until after
                the due date for that assignment. If you have questions that need my
                attention before you submit your homework, send those through the
                Inbox. After I grade an assignment, you will receive a comment from
                me explaining why you lost points (if you lost any) or anything else
                I want to tell you about that assignment.
            </li>
            <li>
                You will need to use the <strong>submit</strong> feature to have
                your work added to my grading queue. Do not add your work as an attachment
                in the comment box, or email it to me, I cannot <strong>submit</strong>
                an assignment for a student.
            </li>
            <li>Use the <span class="strg">Grades</span> tab to check your grades.</li>
            <li>
                Check the <span class="strg">Announcements</span> at least twice a
                week. This is where I will post extra explanations, if needed, explain
                an change to a due date if that happens, identify an error or typo if
                one is found, etc.
            </li>
            <li>
                The <span class="strg">Calendar</span> is where you will find due
                dates for assignments and exams. The assignment dates are also listed
                as an outline at the bottom of the <strong>Syllabus</strong> page
            </li>
            <li>
                The <span class="strg">Modules</span> area is the <strong>
                    most
                    important
                </strong> place for you! This is where I post a document that
                will explain the topic and the requirements for that Module. You can
                use the [Next] and [Back] buttons at the bottom of each page to sequence
                through each page in the module. There are links to each module at the
                bottom of the course Home page.

        <h3 class="alert">Introduction to Web Programming </h3>
        <p>
            In this course you are going to be learning how to develop ASP.NET Core
            MVC web applications (web apps) using the Visual Studio IDE (Integrated
            Development Environment). An Integrated Development Environment is a set
            of tools which provide all of the functionality that you need for developing
            web apps. Visual Studio is the most popular IDE for ASP.NET Core web
            development. Microsoft provides a Community Edition of Visual Studio that
            is available for free and runs on Windows, as well as a free version that
            runs on macOS. The text also mentions a second program, the Visual Studio
            Code editor, that can be used to develop ASP.NET Core apps. However, please
            use the Visual Studio IDE as that is the program I will be using to grade
            your assignments.
        </p>
        <p>
            <span class="strg">Appendix A</span>, p. 727, in your text has instructions
            on how to download and install Visual Studio for Windows. <span class="strg">
                Appendix B
            </span>, p. 735, has instructions on how to download and install
            Visual Studio for macOS.
        </p>
        <p>
            An author will likely spend months writing and editing a textbook. The
            publishing and printing and distribution of the book will take more time.
            If a book is used more than one time to teach a class, it is easy to imagine
            that a considerable amount of time has passed between the time a set of
            instructions was developed and the time it is being read by a student.
            Meanwhile, new releases and updates and patches to a software product may
            be published sometimes daily. For this reason, the installation instructions
            will almost always be out of date, but that does not mean not of value.
            Use them as guidance, but we will be using the latest (stable) product
            release. As of the day I am writing this, I have been using Visual Studio
            2022 for over a year, including the beta release and have no intention of
            reverting to an older build.
        </p>
        <p>
            Sometimes the instructions you read may not match the current product build.
            Products may have incompatibility issues. Staying in sync with new technology
            means sometimes having to search for answers. This is the industry where
            we are and where we work. If you find a solution for an error you encounter
            on StackOverflow for instance, and it was written 4 years ago, it may be
            out of date. Sometimes research takes more than a single Google search.

                Download the <strong>student files</strong> for (1) the source code
                for the book applications, (2) the starting points for the exercises
                that are at the end of each chapter, and (3) the solutions to those
                exercises.

                Once you have reviewed the PowerPoint and readings, use Visual Studio to
                complete Exercise 1-1, to build and run the Guitar Shop app.

                    <li>
                        Zip the folders and files and upload the zipped (not RAR!)
                        <strong>Ch01GuitarShop folder</strong> to the assignment in Canvas.

                        files. The purpose of this assignment is to run the Guitar Shop
                        app and test whether you've successfully installed the Visual
                        Studio IDE and the source code for the textbook.
