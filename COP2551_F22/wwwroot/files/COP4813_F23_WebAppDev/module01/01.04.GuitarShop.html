            <p>
                If you have not already installed Visual Studio, there are step-by-step
                instructions and notes to help in Module 0: Install Visual Studio 2022,
                and also in Appendix A in your text.

            <div class="ic-flash-info">
                <p>
                    Note: Plan some time for installing and configuring Visual Studio.
                    Quite often, this takes much longer than students expect.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you already have it installed, this would be a good time to check
                    the configuration for the required workloads and any updates.

            <p>
                This exercise will follow the step-by-step instructions from Exercise 1-1
                at the end of Chapter 1.
            </p>
            <h3>Start Visual Studio and open the Guitar Shop app</h3>
            <p>
                Although there is no code for you to write in this exercise, take your time
                with it and notice some important points.
            </p>
            <p>
                The <strong>Solution Explorer</strong> in Visual Studio is an important part
                of the environment and provides a lot of useful information at a glance.
            </p>
            <p>
                At the top of the solution explorer, notice the name of the
                <strong>Solution</strong>. More about this later. Below that is the list
                of <strong>Projects</strong>. In the case of the Guitar Shop app, there
                is only one project in the solution, <strong>GuitarShop</strong>. Its
                name is in bold font. A solution may have several projects, but only
                one will be set as the default startup project. You can see this from
                the <em>right-click</em> (on the project name) context menu.
            </p>
            <p class="ic-flash-info" style="font-style:italic">
                These instructions are specific to Windows. I will try and update for macOS
                as time allows.
            </p>
            <p>
                For now, right-click on the solution name and <strong>
                    Open Folder in File Explorer
                </strong>. Here you will see that there is
                a single solution (.sln) file. Right click it and open it in notepad. It is
                a small text file that visual studio uses to configure Visual Studio. It
                contains information about version numbers and which projects are in the
                solution (just one for now). Close that file. Note, ff you double-click
                on one of these .sln files, it will open the solution in Visual Studio.
                Since this solution is already open and running in Visual Studio, you
                won't need to do that.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next, from the File Explorer, open up the GuitarShop folder and look at
                the list of files and folders there. Here you will see one <strong>Project</strong>
                (.csproj) file. Again open this file in a text editor (Right-click > Open with > Notepad).
                This is another small configuration, text file. Look at the settings, but don't
                worry about what they are for now, and close the file without editing it.
            </p>
            <p>
                These configuration files are important to Visual Studio, but you will
                almost never need to edit them directly.
            </p>
            <p>
                Close Notepad (if it's still running) and the File Explorer and return to
                Visual Studio.
            </p>

            <h3>Run the Guitar Shop app</h3>
            <p>
                Continue with the instructions in the exercise to launch the app. As described
                in the chapter, Visual Studio will start a hosting service and the app will
                open in a web browser.
            </p>
            <p>
                The exercise steps point out some important points about the application.
                Read through each carefully.
            </p>
            <p>
                From the browser, notice the URL. It probably says<br />
                <code>https://localhost:#####</code> where #### indicates a pseudo-random
                available port number the browser and host server are using.
            </p>
            <p>
                This is actually a shortcut for the page, try adding<br />
                <code>/Home/Index</code> to the end of the URL. Also, as you click through
                each of the links in the app, notice how the URL changes. We'll learn
                more about these soon.
            </p>
            <p>
                While we are here, try coping the URL and opening another browser and
                navigating to the same [localhost] address. You can open many sessions
                of this page, as long as the app is open. When they are all closed, the
                session will end. If you stop the app (in Visual Studio), the browser
                pages won't close, but if you try refreshing them when the app is no longer
                running, you will see an error.
            </p>

            <h3>Close the Guitar Shop app and exit Visual Studio</h3>
            <p class="ic-flash-info">But wait, there's more!</p>
            <p>
                The final steps in the book include one way to close and exit
                the application and the IDE, there are others.
            </p>

            <h2 class="alert alert-info">Build a New App from the Template</h2>
            <h3>Reopen the Guitar Shop app</h3>
            <p>
                If you closed Visual Studio, reopen it. The Guitar Shop app will 
                be at or near the top of your recent solutions. You can select it from
                there, or choose Open Project or Solution and navigate back to it.
            </p>
            <h3>Add a New Project to the Solution</h3>
            <p>
                From the Solution Explorer, right-click on the solution name near the
                top of the display, and select <strong>Add</strong> and 
                <strong>New Project</strong>. From the <strong>New Project</strong>
                Dialog, you can use the filters to make it easier to find the template.
            </p>
            <p>
                Change 'All languages' to 'C#'.
            </p>
            <p>
                Change 'All project types' to 'Web'
            </p>
            <p>
                Scroll down to find "ASP.NET Core Web App (Model-View-Controller)". There
                are other templates which look very similar. Be sure you choose the one
                with MVC included in the template. Click [Next].
            </p>
            <p>
                By default the new project will be named "WebApplication1" If that project
                already exists, the id number will increment to a unique name. You can use
                the default, or rename the project to "WebApplicationMVCTest". Either is fine.
                Click [Next]
            </p>
            <p>
                Check the Framework, the default should be .NET 6.0 (Long Term Support).
            </p>
            <p>
                Click [Create] and notice that the new project is added to the solution.
                Right-click on the name of the project and select <strong>Set as Startup
                Project</strong>. Click the green triangle (play button) on the toolbar
                to build and start this new project in the debugger. Again it will launch
                the default browser and the hosted app will appear.
            </p>
            <p>
                The MVC template includes a simple HomeController in the Controllers
                folder and a Home folder in the Views folder with an Index.cshtml file
                in it. There is more in the template, but it's enough for now that it
                runs. You will become very familiar with creating MVC web apps.
            </p>

            <p>
                Close Visual Studio and navigate to the folder that contains your
                solution (.sln) file, then open the folder <em>above</em> that one.
            </p>
            <p>
                In Windows 11, use the File Explorer, for macOS, the Finder window.
                From the folder (directory) that <strong>contains</strong> your solution
                file, right-click the folder name and select Compress to ZIP file.
            </p>
            <p>
                This may be a little different in Windows 10, but it works the same way.
            </p>
            <p>
                From macOS, right-click the folder and choose Compress <em>folder_name</em>.
            </p>
            <p>
                Upload your zip file, containing the solution with both projects. Remember
                this contains more than simply the .sln or .prj (or .csproj) files, as
                these do not contain the project code.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you are having trouble Zipping files, Be sure Visual Studio is closed, 
                as well as any applications that may be running in Visual Studio or as 
                background processes and try again.
            </p>
            <p>
                Do not use other archive utilities, such as tar, cpio, gzip, or 7zip, or others.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>
                Before submitting, take a look at the rubric to make sure the assignment
                is correct.
            </p>
            <hr />
            <p>
                Although there was no code to write in this exercise, there was a lot of
                content in chapter 1.
            </p>
            <p> You successfully created a visual studio solution containing two separate
                MVC Web App projects, tested that they run correctly, and zipped the correct 
                files to submit the assignment. This is a good time to flip back through
                the chapter and see if any of the points are clearer from building the 
                application(s) and share any questions you may have.
            </p>
            <p>
                All of these things will be important in the coming chapters. If you
                had any trouble with these things, be sure they are sorted out before 
                going on.
            </p>
            <p>
                Next week, you'll be editing the code to see how all of these things 
                work together.
