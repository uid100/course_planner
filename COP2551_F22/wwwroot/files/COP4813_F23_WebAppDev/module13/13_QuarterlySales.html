        The Bookstore website presented in this chapter is a realistic website
        that uses the skills presented so far in this book. Due to space considerations,
        this chapter doesn’t present every line of code for this website. However, the
        complete code for this website is available in the download for this book. So,
        as you read this chapter, you can run the website to see how it works, and you
        can review its code.

        In this project, you’ll update the Quarterly Sales app so the table that
        displays sales data allows for paging, sorting, and filtering.
        Make a copy of the <strong>11-1_QuarterlySales</strong> files and save the files
        in a new folder named, <strong>13-1_QuarterlySales</strong>.

    <p><strong>Project 13-1 Specifications:</strong></p>
    <ul>
        <li>
            When the app starts, it should display a table of sales data with the following features:
            <ul>
                <li>Drop-downs that allow a user to filter sales by employee, year, and/or quarter.</li>
                <li>Links in the table header that allow a user to sort sales by employee, year, quarter, or amount.</li>
                <li>The first time a user clicks on a sorting link, the data should sort in ascending order. If the user continues clicking on that link, the sorting should toggle between descending and ascending order.</li>
                <li>Display a page of sales records, rather than all the sales records, and provide links below the table that allow the user to navigate through the pages.</li>
            </ul>
        </li>
        <li>The app should have a user-friendly URL that shows the page and page size, sort order and sort direction, and what values are being filtered by. </li>
        <li>
            Note: The Bookstore app from chapter 13 uses a FilterPrefix class to add user-friendly prefixes to the filter segments. However, it’s simpler to use static content in the route to achieve the same result. For example, this app can provide filter segments with a static route like this:<br>
            <code>.../filterby/employee-{employee}/year-{year}/qtr-{quarter}</code>
        </li>
        <li>Zip the folders and files and upload the zipped <strong>13-1_QuarterlySales folder</strong> to the <strong>Module 13 Drop box</strong> in Canvas.</li>
    </ul>
