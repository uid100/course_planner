<h2 class="alert alert-info">Separation of Concerns</h2>
<div class="ic-flash-info">
    <p style="font-weight:bold;">Separation of concerns...</p>
    <p style="font-style:italic;">
        &nbsp;&nbsp; is a design principle in software engineering that advocates 
        for breaking a system into distinct and isolated components, each responsible 
        for a specific aspect or functionality of the system.
    </p>
</div>
<p>
    The concept has been described many ways, using many terms, but the practice of
    <em>Separation of Concerns</em> is a principal concern in software engineering. 
    As computing power became more capable and data storage more practical, the size 
    and complexity of computer applications grew. I've personally worked on many legacy 
    code projects that were described as <em>spaghetti code</em> or <em>Jenga code.</em> 
    These nicknames are sometimes used to describe <em>monolithic</em> applications 
    which grow and grow and are intertwined and have so many inherent dependencies, 
    they become very fragile.
</p>
<p>
    Imagine stirring a giant pot of soup and someone adds some salt and pepper, and 
    someone else visits and adds a little garlic, and another person steps in and 
    decides it needs a little cumin, and another contributor shakes in some paprika. 
    As these become mixed in, trying to remove or replace any single ingredient becomes 
    impossible, and if you wanted to remove any one thing, the best course of action 
    is to get a new pot and start over.
</p>
<p>
    This paved the way to the concept of multi-layered or <em>n-tiered</em> architectures 
    and frameworks. Instead of the soup pot, we can use <em>salad bar</em> approach. 
    Take the components that you want, combine them together, each component may 
    interact with one another and even complement each other, but they remain 
    identifiable as individual components.
</p>
<p>
    I may have an application which accesses the card catalog from the local library, 
    makes requests for book availability, perhaps for transfer to another nearby library 
    request, and another application may use that same card catalog for a different 
    application which tracks historical patterns and other metrics so that a single 
    neighborhood library does not end up with 27 copies of a book that has very little 
    interest, and another has 1 copy of a text that is in high regional demand. The 
    idea is that card catalog (or database) can be<em>loosely</em> tied to each of 
    those applications, but still be useful on its own. And if the database is migrated 
    to a new database with the same interface, those applications do not need to be 
    rewritten because of a simple configuration change.
</p>
<p>
    The Model-View-Controller framework is a good example of multi-layered, or 
    <em>n-tiered</em> solutions. If I keep my components small and simple, each doing 
    one thing, then mixing and matching them should be relatively simple. The data 
    model may be reusable by other applications. Many different view representations 
    can reuse the same sets of data.
</p>
<p>
    Think about weather. I can display a map view of Northern Florida, or a table 
    of local cities and regional temperatures and rainfall totals, or I can display
    radar and satellite tracking. All of those are different views, or ways of 
    looking at the same data. These are also called representational states.
</p>
<p>
    Also, in the same way that different applications can share data sources, 
    applications can use multiple data sources. In other words, in the first case,
    multiple stores can sell the same products, but a store location might host 
    multiple seasonal, or pop-up vendors.
</p>
<p>
    In object-oriented programming, you'll often hear the expression <em>loosely-coupled, 
    and highly cohesive.</em> If this is new to you, read it again, write it down, 
    commit it to memory.
</p>
<p>
    These are more than buzz-words, but they are important discussion topics in 
    any technical interview. It means that my components should be designed and 
    built so that they play well with others, but not dependent on them. My 
    component does exactly what it needs to do, but nothing 'extra.' The Swiss 
    Army Knife is a great example which of a tool that does 14 things, but none 
    of them very well.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="alert alert-info">Web Application Designs</h2>
<p>
    I've enjoyed reading your ideas for your web development. I promise that we 
    will be doing more with those. For now, think about the concept of modular 
    components and n-tiered architecture. Without getting into details, start to 
    think about how you can make your big ideas into piles of smaller ones.
</p>
<p>
    How can you disassemble the project into small pieces?
</p>
<p>
    This is week 4. Week 3 raced passed me! We have had family staying with us,
    and our normally quiet house was not. I love my family and love having them 
    close, but I'm ready for a return to relative normal. My daughter is an 
    executive for a large corporation and also a founding partner in an unrelated 
    business venture. Last week she consulted with me about some ideas for a web 
    application that their startup needs, so I'm going through a similar process. 
    I know that this application will need to grow, so it needs to be well-designed 
    from the beginning, but it also needs to have simple components so that as 
    pieces evolve and newer features are added, they will integrate well and be
    easy to manage.
</p>
<p>
    This week, please <span style="background-color: #fbeeb8;"><strong>continue 
    with your discussions,</strong></span> consider the different ideas presented 
    and imagine what the smaller components might be. What do the data models look 
    like? Are there different ways of viewing the same data so that looking at it 
    from a different perspective, doesn't require a restructuring of the application? 
    Often engineers might gather around a whiteboard with a customer and sketch 
    block diagrams indicating how data might flow from one data storage point or 
    another. What data will be collected from the user? Will that data be stored 
    or used as processing inputs? These design ideas are still concepts, not 
    logical lines of code yet. That's still coming.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="alert alert-info">Bootstrap and Responsive Design</h2>
<p>
    Front-end design and CSS, I love using bootstrap. The grid concept and 
    <em>mobile-first</em> design principals have changed the way I build applications. 
    Like so many concepts in this textbook and this course, I really wish there 
    was more time to deep-dive, investigate, discuss and practice more of what is in
    this chapter, but one of my goals for this course isn't that you become experts
    in all of the topics immediately, but that you are able to apply them, and quickly
    find and return to the resources when you need them.
</p>
<p>
    I know that you're all busy. I suspect that translates to having to prioritize 
    some things over others. And what I also suspect is that since there wasn't 
    anything directly assigned from the chapter (using Bootstrap), some of you (I know,
    <em>most of you</em>) may have raced over some of that concept. And that's ok. 
    It is. But let me encourage you that if you skimmed over the content the first 
    time, at least skim over it again. Even if we don't have time to instill a strong 
    working knowledge of this material, understand that this is a good reference to 
    have. Sometimes it's enough to know where to find the answer quickly when you
    don't have the answer right away.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="alert alert-info">Data-driven Applications</h2>
<p>
    All of this comes together this week with a focus on data models. Think about 
    different <strong>representations</strong> of the same data. The data itself needs 
    to be well-structured to support this. <em>Strongly-typed</em> views only work if 
    the data models (or data-view models) are correctly built.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2 class="alert alert-info">Final thoughts</h2>
<p>
    Don't forget to visit the Discord discussion channel! I know that other classes 
    have been doing more <em>coding</em> up to this point, but that doesn't mean more
    <em>development.</em> I suspect as we get further along with your web applications, 
    the discussions there will pick up too.
