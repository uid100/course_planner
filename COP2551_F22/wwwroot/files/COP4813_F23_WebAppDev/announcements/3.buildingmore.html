<!-- COP4813 Week2 - Building More Web Apps -->

<h2>Discussions</h2>
<p>Week 1 introduction discussions! &nbsp;Thank you for those. It's a crazy busy semester for me, but I do genuinely enjoy reading them. By this point, I assume that most, if not all, of you have had a lot of classes together and are getting more familiar with one another. That's good. It's difficult to build community in a remote class environment. I don't often use the Canvas Discussion Board tool beyond those initial introductions, but in this class we are going to. I'll get back to that.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h2>Project Build</h2>
<p>In Week 1 you installed and configured Visual Studio to make sure that everything is ready to build web apps. Sometimes the installation can be a little tricky and time-consuming. Assuming the installation went well, there really wasn't much to the assignment. Open the solution, build the code, run the application.</p>
<p>The second part, building and running an empty shell from the templates, and managing multiple projects in your solution is also an important task, but probably not much of a stretch. I can imagine that if the installation didn't go smoothly, this could have taken some time, but not very challenging compared to the courses leading up to it. Don't worry. We'll be writing plenty of code coming up. I may modify this first assignment for next time to have the students modify the template, or change the text in the GuitarShop, but I don't know. The biggest objective is to make sure your systems are set up and you are comfortable getting started building web apps.</p>

<h2>Get Ready and Go!</h2>
<p>This week you'll read through Chapter 2. You will want to follow these examples as you progress through the chapter. You should be trying out each step through the book. Yes, it will take some time. For these projects, There have been major changes in recent versions of C# and .NET. As I have said, that is why it was important to move to the newer edition of the textbook. The older one really has been out of date for a little while. These changes are most noticeably in the visual studio project templates. I have done a preliminary look through the book and done some testing, but I will continue to test throughout the semester to make sure the course is still up to date. Remember, if you find any changes, or broken links or broken images, let me know right away. I'm also trying to test on both Windows and macos. I know there are some places in the process that are going to be very different, but for most of the text, both platforms, if not the tools, should work very similarly.</p>
<p>Give yourself plenty of time to work through this chapter and the exercises. This is not the week to procrastinate! There is a lot going on in this chapter, and if this is the first time that you are seeing it, It may not make sense. Follow the instructions carefully. Send your questions (or post on Discord) when you get stuck or when you have moments of enlightenment!</p>

<h2>Student Web Application Development</h2>
<p>Just to give you a little sneak peak, Next week we'll be starting work on a new project. This one is yours. The project requirements, the projects specifications, the customer, the project manager, the design and development team, the test team will consist of you.</p>
<p>Over the course of many weeks, we will be building useful web applications of our own designs. Most web applications are visited and viewed by mobile devices. Most of the time, with iPhone (iOS) or Android phones or tables. Your mobile application could target the device and you could build native applications, but building web applications instead makes your process available and accessible to anyone with a network connection, and virtually any device type. This is one of the reasons I find building web applications so satisfying.</p>
<p>For class, we will be focusing on the process more than the product. You may decide to build one project or many. In my garage, I have several projects in various stages on a number of different workbenches. All are valid and each is important for its own purpose, but each is expected to have a beginning, some intermediate steps, and (hopefully) an ending. These projects will be a yours to showcase some of the good work that you are doing, and also show your enthusiasm for the subject -maybe for potential employers, more about that later.</p>
<p>Next week you'll start by identifying a project or two that you want to design and build, and we'll be writing up your design plans and ideas and sharing those ideas with one another.</p>
<p>For this week, to get ready, start thinking about the web applications that you know and use. Get a good definition in your own mind of what really is a web application.</p>
<p>The fun is just getting started!</p>
