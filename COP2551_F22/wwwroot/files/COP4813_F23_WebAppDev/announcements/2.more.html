<p><em>What? Part 2? More already?</em></p>
<p>
    Yes, I like using the Announcements in Canvas, since they notify students email and each
    of my courses is configured (usually) to display the most recent two (2) announcements
    at the top of the course home page. If you ever miss an announcement, or want to go back
    and read something that has scrolled beyond the most recent 2, use the
    <strong>Announcements&nbsp;</strong>item from the Canvas menu, usually on the left side
    of the screen to see the full list.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    I'll be posting more in Discord too. The great thing about that is that students respond
    and my announcements can become discussions.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Some of you have gotten started. I've seen the posts in the Discussion board, but haven't
    had a chance to dive in yet. I'm looking forward to that, but it's the first week, so I've
    been pretty busy getting a lot of things and people settled in place for the start of the
    semester.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    This week, and this module looks like there's a lot of <em>stuff</em> to do. Really it's
    a lot of reading. This week's lab assignment is really very simple. Don't rush through it
    though. This semester I am teaching courses in Java, C#, Python, and this one. It's a lot
    like having children when you're not allowed to tell one that they're the favorite,
    but... you are!
</p>

<p>
    Ok, let me explain. I really like writing code. Really, I do. And I enjoy teaching, and 
    all of the languages that I mentioned, but when I have projects to do, writing web apps are 
    usually my favorite, and using an MVC template hosted on ASP.NET, especially cloud hosting, 
    is my <em>happy place</em>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Project #1</h3>
<p>
    <em>So what is the objective?</em>
</p>
<p>
    The first thing is to make sure your computer is ready and configured to start writing 
    code, building and hosting your web apps. Yes, this is important, but there's more.
</p>
<p>
    We're sending you out to walk through the forest and look at all the things, and there's 
    so much to see, but let me point to a couple of things for you to notice.
</p>
<p>
    First, open it up, take a quick glance at all the files. Don't forget to unzip them 
    before you try to open them. This sounds obvious, but modern operating systems will 
    let you browse the contents of a zip file without actually unzipping it. And yes, it's 
    something that I still do, pretty often.
</p>
<p>
    In the root folder, you'll see a solution (.sln) file and a folder (directory) ....
</p>
<div class="alert alert-info">
    <p>*<em>brakes squealing... wait, wait, wait!*</em></p>
    <p>
        If you haven't already done this, make sure your File Explorer (Windows) or 
        Finder (Mac) are set to (1) <strong>show file extensions</strong> and (2) 
        <strong>hidden files</strong>. These are simple configuration steps. It's 
        really important, but I'm going to leave it to you to look up the steps for 
        your particular operating system.</p>
</div>
<p>
    <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" 
         src="/courses/465444/file_contents/course%20files/course_image/01/guitarshop_directory.png" 
         alt="directory listing" />
</p>
<p>
    The solution file (.sln) is a text file. Try opening it with your favorite text 
    editor first to see what's in it.<br />
    <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" 
         src="/courses/465444/file_contents/course%20files/course_image/01/guitarshop_slnfile.png" 
         alt="solution file contents" />
    without knowing anything about it, it looks like it has some configuration settings. 
    "VisualStudioVersion" probably tells me what built it, Minimum-- probably how far 
    back it will support, it's got a project  and an equals with a "GuitarShop" string 
    and a relative path to a .csproj file (we'll find out later that is a project file). 
    There are what look to be opening and closing tags and a bunch of GUID- looking 
    numbers. Nothing that looks like familiar C# code though. I suppose this is a 
    configuration file that tells visual studio what to do and how to open files up.
</p>
<p>
    I suppose I could navigate to that .csproj file and look inside that, but I'm getting 
    impatient, so I'll wait until later.
</p>
<p>
    Double click the solution file and Visual Studio launches (if it's installed) and the 
    solution (with the project) opens up.
</p>
<p>
    By default, the Solution Explorer is open. I like this tool and unless I'm really 
    limited for screen space, I always have it open.
</p>
<p>
    <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" 
         src="/courses/465444/file_contents/course%20files/course_image/01/guitarshop_folders.png" 
         alt="GuitarShop solution explorer" />
</p>
<p>
    I usually do this on my Windows PC, but I like to code and test in both environments, 
    so here's what it looks like on Visual Studio for Mac.
</p>
<p>
    The file structure is important. At the top, there is a "solution." This is from 
    that text file that we looked at. Next is a project. The solution may contain 
    multiple projects, but for now, just the one is enough. This is described in 
    that GuitarShop.csproj text file that we didn't look at yet.
</p>
<p>
    Inside the Project Folder, there are a handful of folders and some files in the 
    root folder. It looks like a random mess, but it's actually very intentionally 
    organized.
</p>
<p>
    Notice there are separate folders for <strong>Models, Views, and 
    Controllers.</strong> These are plural, so they may contain many. We'll be 
    discussing what goes inside each, but for now, they're kept carefully together.
</p>
<p>
    In the project folder there are C Sharp (.cs) files, Program and Startup. More 
    on these later, but this is how our program will be launched. There's a json 
    file and a couple of ".cshtml" files. We know about .cs files and we know about 
    .html files, but this is some kind of strange hybrid of the two. And yes, we'll
    talk more about them later.
</p>
<p>
    <em>Ok, let's start this thing!</em>
</p>
<p>
    Like any C# program, we need to compile and build it first. You can use the 
    build menu to make sure it all builds without errors and watch the process. 
    But you probably already know that if you just use the run or debug command, 
    anything that needs to be built, will.
</p>
<p>
    <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" 
         src="/courses/465444/file_contents/course%20files/course_image/01/guitarshop_homepage.png" 
         alt="home page, running." />
</p>
<p>
    Here, the application is launched and running in my Google Chrome browser 
    and if you look closely, you'll notice that it's running on my local computer 
    on port 5001. This may be very different on another computer or on another 
    configuration. Just notice the port number for now. You won't need it, but 
    it's worth noticing. You can copy that URL and open it in another browser 
    if you want to see what that looks like.
</p>
<p>
    <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" 
         src="/courses/465444/file_contents/course%20files/course_image/01/guitarshop_prodlist.png" 
         alt="Products menu" />
</p>
<p>
    You can click through the menu items to see the different pages. Here is 
    the product list, this time viewed on the Safari web browser. This image 
    doesn't show it, but in Chrome it's easier to see that the URL is now
    "https://localhost:5001/Product/List"
</p>
<p>
    We'll learn more about this later, but what it means is that we're using
    the "https://"&nbsp; Hyper-Text Transfer Protocol (HTTP), over Secure 
    Socket Layer (SSL), to the server at "localhost," on port 5001, and 
    calling the <strong>Product</strong> controller and the <strong>List</strong> 
    action method.
</p>
<p>
    If it worked, then you have everything up and running and you're ready to 
    keep going.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3>Keep going!</h3>
<p>
    In the first part of the exercise, you're really just taking the author's 
    code, opening it, building it, and running it. But there's a second part 
    to the assignment too. Build a new web app using the built in .NET templates. 
    There still isn't any code to write this week, but this is an exercise that 
    you'll want to be very familiar with. You might even consider trying it a 
    few times. How many clicks does it take to build and run the app?
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <em>Are you going to keep doing this?&nbsp;</em>
</p>
<p>
    I know. I've given you a lot to read this week. But if we were in class, 
    I'd have your attention for at least a couple of hours, so giving you 
    another page to read doesn't seem like that much. Hopefully that 
    walk-through was helpful. My <strong>Announcements</strong> won't be 
    more than <em>about</em> weekly. For most of the class, we'll be stepping 
    through the book, coding the exercises in the book and submitting one 
    <em>about&nbsp;</em>every other chapter. These are so much fun though, 
    I'm sure you'll want to work on more than just those! (<em>Favorites!</em>
    Remember? )
</p>
<p>
    Actually, in many cases, we get a lot more discussion on our Discord 
    server, and the announcements will get fewer.
</p>
<p>
    <strong>Be sure to check in to Discord, at least weekly!</strong>
</p>
<p>
    I do have another project for you to develop beyond the book, and over 
    the course of several weeks. I'll be telling you more about that next week.
</p>

<p>
    As a reminder, visit my office hours if you have questions, or drop a 
    note in Discord at any hour!
