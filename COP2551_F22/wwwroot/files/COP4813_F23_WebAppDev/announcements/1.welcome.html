    I'm Dan. This is me. Ok, this was me about ten years ago. My hair's grayer, 
    eyesight worse, clothes are tighter, but my beautiful wife likes this picture.

<p>
    This is a 16-week course in designing and building Web Applications using C# 
    and the MVC framework for ASP.NET Core.
</p>

<p>Read that again.&nbsp;</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><em>What is a web application?</em></h3>
<p>
    As you already know, a webpage is a document that is formatted using HTML tags. 
    You should already be familiar with what they look like and how to write them. 
    Now imagine every time someone searches Amazon for "lunch box for back to school," 
    or "licensed NFL jersey," or "western saddle," or whatever your last 5 Amazon 
    searches contained. Each of those pages is an HTML formatted page which is 
    dynamically created, just for the moment, and isn't stored on any server after 
    it has been delivered. That is the difference between a web page and a web 
    application.
</p>
<p>
    You could probably write a visually compelling page containing a restaurant's 
    logo, their address, and maybe even their menu choices, but a page result that 
    contains the weather forecast for the next 3 days in any city would need to be 
    generated by a program, using designed elements to make it visually appealing 
    and useful.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><em>.NET/C# and what?</em></h3>
<p>
    You have already built applications using C# for .NET. ASP is Microsoft's 
    Active Server Pages solution that will handle the details of the page transfer 
    for we don't have to dive that deep into the protocols. We point Visual Studio 
    to serve us a web page, and ASP does the rest for us.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><em>MVC framework?</em></h3>
<p>
    A framework is a pattern or a set of guidelines and best practices to follow 
    which can make a product easier to build and maintain. If you walk through a 
    house which is under construction, and the walls are just going up, you can 
    use your imagination and picture what it's going to look like. You may not 
    have the builder's vision for tile and color and landscaping, but you'll 
    recognize interior doorways which are usually 78 inches high and even without 
    anything installed, you can probably identify which rooms are intended to be 
    bathrooms, bedrooms, kitchens, closets and so on. All this from just looking 
    at the <em>framework</em>.
</p>
<p>
    Using the Model-View-Controller design pattern, a developer will be able to 
    quickly construct and maintain an application and ensure that it is properly 
    constructed, and when it needs to be updated, you will know where to go to 
    make the changes.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<h3><em>Sounds like a lot!</em></h3>
<p>
    It is! We have a lot of material to cover but it is designed to build on the 
    knowledge and experience you already have. We will start with some assumptions.
    You might want to go back and revisit coding in C#, run a few simple programs 
    to refresh your memory of the syntax especially if it has been a while. We 
    will be reinforcing common patterns and strategies, some will be new, and as 
    with every new language, the way to succeed and even <strong><em>enjoy</em></strong> 
    the experience is to immerse yourself in it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Of course, full-immersion suggests that you're either waiting around for access 
    to your trust fund, or lottery winnings, or you just sold your first company to 
    Jeff Bezos, and you have nothing else to do. &nbsp;(<em>Anyone? No?</em>)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Ok, for the rest of us, if you can trust the word of a complete stranger 
    (<em>a friend you haven't met yet,</em>) I can promise you that the more 
    time that you are able to commit to this pursuit, the more <strong>enjoyment</strong> 
    you'll get in return. I know. I used that term again! The truth is, I do
    <strong>enjoy</strong> programming. I think a lot of us do. If you don't, 
    consider finding something else to do, because career programming only gets 
    more demanding. Programming is a blend of science and art. And the more 
    challenging something is, the greater the sense of satisfaction when you 
    achieve it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    I know that, in reality, most of us have family and jobs and bills and 
    other priorities.
</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">
    <em>Hey, the sun is shining, there's a building south swell, and my friends 
    are all headed to the beach with a case of&nbsp;<strong>my</strong> favorite 
    beverage on ice!</em>
</p>
<p>Ok, or more likely,</p>
<p style="padding-left: 40px;">
    <em>the lawn needs to be mowed, the kids have soccer practice, the roof is 
    leaking, and it's the busy season, so overtime at work is no longer 
    optional</em>.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    I know that life is about balancing priorities, and this course is probably 
    not at the top of that list. If you want to succeed in this class, I can promise 
    you that it will require a time commitment.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>So what can you expect?</p>
<p>
    There are 16 weeks in the term. We're going to walk through Murach's ASP.NET
    Core MVC (2nd Edition!) textbook
</p>
<p>
    This course was built using the previous edition of the book, and for an 
    emerging technology, there was simply too much that needed updating. That's 
    the reason for the new book edition. On the other hand, because it's a new 
    edition, I have gone through the material to ensure content and references 
    are updated, but if I've missed anything, let me know!
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    We're going to be using Microsoft Visual Studio. The current release is '2022.' 
    The Community Edition is a free download. It will take some time and not an 
    insignificant amount of storage space on your computer, but it is the industry 
    standard and you will need this to be successful. I have a current 
    release, and will be installing any updates this weekend. We're not working on 
    legacy code, so there's no reason not to use the latest and find any sticking 
    points as we go along. (<em>Real-world stuff!</em>).
</p>
<p>
    Our textbook may reference different versions of the tool, and we may encounter 
    some differences and even some challenges along the way, but that really is what 
    we sometimes face as code developers. When you find these things, let us know 
    and we'll work through them together. (Discord is great for that!)
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    <strong>Mostly, we'll be writing a lot of code. Set aside some time.</strong> 
    Write out the examples in the book as you are reading. The time will be well 
    spent. Related to that, some of the sample code is available as a download from 
    the publisher. In general, I firmly believe that you'll get more out of typing 
    the examples yourself than you ever will simply reviewing pre-written code. You 
    won't learn to play the guitar by listening alone, you need to have your fingers 
    on the strings. In much the same way, there are keyboard shortcuts that you pick 
    up along the way, but the <strong>learning experience requires trying things and making 
    mistakes.</strong>
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    There are (online) exams to reinforce the content in the book, and some projects 
    to apply what you are reading about and practicing with sample code. You'll also 
    be working on a unique project all your own, but you'll hear more about that later.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p
   Speaking of&nbsp;<em>online, </em>the college lists this as a <em>web</em> course. 
    You'll also hear it referred to as <em>asynchronous.</em> We won't have scheduled 
    meetings, but we do have a class schedule to accomplish. The Canvas course is 
    designed to guide you through, but we'll do it together, and I will make an effort 
    to not let you feel&nbsp;alone through the process.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What to do next?</p>
<p>
    Find the course from your Canvas dashboard linked from the college website. Read 
    through the front page material and take a look at the links that are there. I've 
    tried to set it up so that all of the logical navigation links that you'll want 
    are there. You can find out more about me, about the course, read the syllabus 
    (there's a lot there) and then go to the first module and start reading the first 
    chapter of the book. In this first exercise, you wil download the author's code, 
    build it, and get familiar with the process and structure. I highly recommend that 
    you start and end your reading sessions with the table of contents. Use this 
    outline to find out what's in the chapter, and then as a quick review to remind 
    yourself what you have read. The publisher's PowerPoint slides for the chapter 
    are also in the module for this purpose as well.
</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    I have scheduled times during the week when you can easily find me online. Please 
    note that I travel often, but all of the times listed in the course are local time 
    at Santa Fe College (EST).
