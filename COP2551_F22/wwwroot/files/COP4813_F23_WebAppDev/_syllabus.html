                                &#10003; In COP4813, you are going to be learning how to develop
                                ASP.NET Core MVC using the Visual Studio IDE. Microsoft
                                provides a Community Edition of Visual Studio that is available for
                                free and runs on Windows, as well as a free version that runs on
                                macOS. The Visual Studio set-up program installs the most current
                                version of .NET Core, as well as SQL Server 2016 Express LocalDB.
                                You must use the Visual Studio IDE as that is the program your
                                instructor will use to grade your homework submissions.

                I will be using the Canvas Course Management system for class activities. In addition to
                participating in online discussions, taking exams online and submitting labs online, I may
                provide various learning resources such as PowerPoint slides for each chapter, lecture/chapter
                notes, videos and code samples as needed to help you get through the chapter material. You are
                welcome and encouraged to use these learning resources in addition to the text material. Please
                feel free to ask if there's a particular code sample or a demonstration video that you need that
                isn't already available. I'm here to help you succeed.

                I will periodically (usually weekly) post announcements to the Class Announcements page
                and/or send out e-mails to class members that may include things such as class announcements,
                assignment due dates, exam reminders, and answers to frequently asked questions. To ensure that
                you are "kept in the loop", please make sure your e-mail address in Canvas is an e-mail account
                you check on a regular basis.

                Lab exercises and projects are intended to help reinforce the various program design and
                coding concepts being taught in the class. I will try to make the assignments "within reason"
                such that they can be completed within the allotted time but this may vary depending on the
                material and your prior experience. Due dates for each lab are posted in Canvas with the lab a
                ssignment. Please check the due date carefully and recheck periodically as I may adjust due
                dates depending on the needs of the class.

                There are also discussion forums on Canvas where you can post questions. I am also available

                There is an open discussion board for engaging with other students. Ask questions. Posting short code
                'snippets' to support questions is acceptable. Posting complete solutions as 'examples' is not.

                place for one more semester (who knows)<br />
                In the past, I've tried the Canvas discussion board, #Slack, and others, but (CS) students have been most
                receptive to using Discord, so I've recently jumped on board.<br />There is a link to the channel(s) on
                the home page to join. It is optional. I won't monitor the channel(s) all the time, but I will drop by.
                Feel free to engage in conversations there and answer eachother's questions too.

                    done in a team environment, team members are expected to contribute substantial original effort to their
                    assigned portion(s) of a project. Information technology professionals are expected to work to a high
                    professional and ethical standard.
