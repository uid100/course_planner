            In Module 3, there are two major objectives.
            <li>
                First, read through Chapter 3 to learn about using the Bootstrap
                client-side css library to create <em>responsive</em> page designs.
            </li>
            <li>
                Additionally, we will start to create a unique web application that
                will become part of your professional portfolio. We will talk more
                about this in the coming weeks.

        <p>
            In chapter 2, you were shown how to apply styles with cascading style
            sheets (CSS). In chapter 3, the author uses the Bootstrap css library
            to dynamically style a web application as the window changes size or
            when a user launches a page on various mobile devices.
        </p>
        <p>
            Developed for the Twitter project, Bootstrap has become the most popular
            CSS library. The patterns and elements are so widely used, it's part of
            Microsoft's template projects. I use Bootstrap in just about all of the
            coding projects that I deliver now. You'll want to spend some time in
            this chapter, and refer back to it for future projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            Arguably, most web browsing now is done on mobile devices. These may
            vary widely in size and capabilities. Modern web pages should be able
            adapt to any device or window size which makes a request.
        </p>
        <p>
            Read the chapter and review the PowerPoint slides and try the recommended
            exercises, ex.3-1, and ex.3-2. This is a good opportunity to try changing
            a few things from what is written to get a good feel for how they work.

        <h3 class="alert alert-info">Content Delivery Networks (CDNs)</h3>
        <p>
            A point that is almost missed in this chapter is the idea of Content Delivery 
            Networks or CDNs. You are probably familiar with Cascading Style-Sheets (CSS)
            and how to apply styles using this text-based stylesheet approach, and easily 
            editing and attaching these stylesheets to your project.
        </p>
        <p>
            Using bootstrap is similar, but there is a significant difference. You can
            download the files to your project and even edit them to your preference, but
            <strong>don't</strong>! These CSS files are intended to be used as is. In fact,
            They not only have a complexity, which discourages customizing, they can also
            be quite large and add a lot of extra weight (size) to your projects.
        </p>
        <p>
            The good news is that because of their popularity, and that they don't need
            to be cusomized, they are probably already reisdent on your user's computer,
            and if they aren't, and they do need to be downloaded (the first time), they
            can be accessed from fast, distributed servers, close to your user, which means
            that your application can load faster and not worry about having to transmit the
            extra content files.

                    This week we will also be introducing a new project. Think about the
                    distinction between a web application and a web page. Start to think in
                    terms of how you might define a web application. Your definition may
                    continue to develop and evolve as you learn more.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For this week, start with a survey of web sites and applications which
                    you have visited. What is it about them that sets them apart? Do they
                    provide helpful information? Is the content current? Is the page visually
                    appealing? Does it load quickly?
                </p>
                <p>
                    Consider the factors which are important to you, and start to develop
                    ideas about the web project which you will build. This week you'll
                    share some ideas on a discussion board, and provide thoughtful review
                    feedback for others. Go to the discussion page to learn more.
