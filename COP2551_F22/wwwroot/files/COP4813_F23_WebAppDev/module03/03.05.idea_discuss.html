    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p>This week we will launch our unique web application development project. The project will evolve over the duration of the course. Each assignment is designed to highlight a particular phase of the Software Development Life Cycle <strong>(SDLC).</strong></p>
    <p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" src="https://miro.medium.com/max/1400/1*GU-YWDqM-ZljYHGs1iDNPg.jpeg" alt="Phases of the SDLC" width="598" height="300" /></p>
    <p>Although most engineers agree that there will be some inherent recursion and overlap between the phases of the SDLC, and that the process framework will be tailored according to the scope of each project, the sequence and objective of each phase shouldn't be overlooked.</p>
    <p>This week you'll be identifying and researching project ideas. In the next couple of weeks, you'll narrow the scope and present your idea and preliminary design to your peers, gather feedback, and further refine your project plan.</p>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>
    <p>Your project doesn't need to be brand new and unique, but your implementation will.</p>
    <p>Begin to think about the kind of project to showcase. List the specific functionalities of the chosen kind of project, and some preliminary investigation toward implementing the project. All projects must include:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>a data component</li>
        <li>and an interface component</li>
    </ul>
    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <p>These projects are student effort and student driven. Over the course of the semester, each student will be completing various tasks associated with software product development. You may have 1, 2, or several projects complete or in progress at the end of the term. The deliverables will be progress presented through the discussion boards, each student will own their own project.</p>

        <h2>Background</h2>
        <p>For this project, start by browsing the internet and considering websites that you commonly visit. What is it about the site that makes it useful? Are there other sites that enable similar functionality? What makes it appealing? What problem does it solve?</p>
        <ul>
            The project is designed to:
            <li>give a realistic look at the larger life cycle of taking ideas and turning them into useful software-based systems</li>
            <li>provide insight into the organizational and inter-personal aspects of project management</li>
            <li>give experience with change management, builds and controls, and other management disciplines necessary to keep projects heading towards success (and keep costs within budget!)</li>
            <li>give design, build, test and support experience with software systems</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This is an individual project. Each student is building a portfolio that reflects their growth and development as a software and systems professional.</p>
        <p>But it is also a collaborative project. There will be opportunity to discuss and work with classmates informally and formally as parts of task-focused teams.</p>
        <p>Some of these deliverables will be formal documents, or code files, or reports; others will be accomplished with formal or informal presentations, discussions, whiteboarding, or other options.</p>
        <p>The instructor will guide the project and the process, step by step.</p>

        <h2>Sample Ideas</h2>
        <p>You may choose your own project. Here is a list of sample projects for you to get started.</p>
        <p>This list is intended to spark ideas, not limit them. You may choose one of these or something else entirely.</p>
        <dl>
            <dt>School system</dt>
            <dd>This may consist of a student module, an instructor module, a curriculum module, and provides for the assignment of instructors to classes, students to classes, course management, student management, an d instructor management. As example would be the CSU student information system.</dd>
            <dt>Electronic learning system</dt>
            <dd>This may consist of a collection of courses. Each course may allow for tests, quizzes, exercises, research papers, discussions, etc. As example would be Cougarview.</dd>
            <dt>An auction system.</dt>
            <dd>This my consist of a sellers module, a bidders module, a purchase module, and provide for different kinds of sales (i.e., open bidding, bidding with reserve, buy now, etc.). It would include user registrations and appropriate databases of auctions, transactions, etc. An example would be eBay.</dd>
            <dt>Messaging system</dt>
            <dd>This would include user registrations, posting messages, sending messages, composing groups, and similar functionality. An example would be Twitter.</dd>
            <dt>Encyclopedia</dt>
            <dd>This would include editor registrations, posting entries, editing entries, search functions, analytical functions, and similar functionality. An example would be Wikipedia.</dd>
            <dt>Electronic voting system</dt>
            <dd>This would include voter registrations, candidate qualification, casting ballots with appropriate authentication, and calculation of results. An example would be the current voting system in Georgia.</dd>
            <dt>Networking system</dt>
            <dd>This would include user registrations, posting employment data, school data, certification data, allow the posting of jobs, etc. An example would be LinkedIn.</dd>
            <dt>Online store</dt>
            <dd>This would implement the display of merchandise, a shopping cart, a payment module, and inventory control mechanism, etc. An example would be Amazon.</dd>
            <dt>Database GUI</dt>
            <dd>This would implement a graphical front end to a database. Modules would (1) create or drop databases, (2) create, drop, and alter tables, (3) insert, update, or delete data, and (4) run simple queries. An example would be TOAD.</dd>
            <dt>Organization system</dt>
            <dd>This might include member registration, a member directory, an event calender, a newsletter, a photo album, a FAQ, or other functions suitable for organizations.
