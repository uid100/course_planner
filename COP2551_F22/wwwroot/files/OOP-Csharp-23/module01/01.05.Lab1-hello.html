        <h2 class="alert alert-info">Getting Started</h2>
        <p>
            At a very simple starting point, virtually every computer program:
            <ul>
                <li>accepts input</li>
                <li>processes data</li>
                <li>generates output</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p class="ic-flash-info" style="text-align:center;">
            input &gt; process &gt; output
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Input</strong> can be reading a file, enabling keyboard entry
            or mouse clicks, waiting for a timer to expire, or a pedestrian to press
            the button to request a WALK signal.
        </p>
        <p>
            <strong>Processing</strong> may be simple such adding numbers on a
            calculator Application or complex such as calculating the required
            trajectory to launch a satellite into geo-stationary orbit.
        </p>
        <p>
            Program <strong>output</strong> may include displaying the contents of
            a data file on a computer monitor or transmitting a message to an email
            server or sending a control signal to trigger a measured current to a
            medical defibrallator.
        </p>
        <p>
            Not all programs will be sequential, or simple step-by-step,
            start-to-finish instruction sets, there may be logic loops and
            conditional decision points, but consider that all systems can be
            described, at least as a starting point in these simple terms and
            logic algorithms, or instructions, will make sense.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <h3 class="alert alert-info">Hello World</h3>
        <p>
            There is a simple program that is familiar to all developers. Almost
            every programming language book, tutorial, or course starts with a
            simple <code>helloworld</code> program to bridge the human-machine
            interface. By writing simple programming instructions, we ask the
            computer to do something.
        </p>
        <p>
            Computer instructions are written as <em>source code</em> using a
            programming language. The choice of programming language may vary
            based on capabilities, system requirements, interoperability, or
            even programmer or engineer preference. Sometimes the decision is
            based only on which language the developer has the most familiarity
            and the most knowledge and comfort.
        </p>
        <p>
            All of the most popular programming languages in use are either
            compiled or interpreted. Programs, or computer instruction sets are
            written using a friendlier, human readable language which is usually
            similar or familiar to the programmers native spoken language and
            saved as text files. Text files do not store information about font
            sizes and styles, just simple letters and numbers and common
            punctuation which can be written and read from simple editors on
            just about any computing system. Some languages require that these
            saved text files, called source code, be run through another program,
            called a compiler to output another file which contains instructions
            which are easier, and faster, for the computer to understand.
        </p>
        <p>
            Other languages run interpreters which read the source code and tell
            the computer what to do without storing the intermediate computer file.
        </p>
        <p>
            As an example, a program written in the C programming language, will
            be stored as a text file, and given a name with a .c file extension,
            and then run through a C compiler program, such as cc or gcc, and
            might be output as a binary file which might have a .exe file extension
            for use on a Windows PC and can run on its own.
        </p>
        <p>
            In contrast, a program written in the Python language requires the
            Python interpreter to be running on the host machine when the program
            runs. In both of these cases (C and Python) the language is widely
            supported and the source code can be compiled or interpreted and run
            on Windows, MacOS or Linux computer systems with little to no changes.
        </p>

                This lab provides an introduction to programming in C#. You will
                begin by creating simple C# console application and analyzing it
                to identify the various parts.
            </p>
            <p>
                For this lab, follow the steps described below. The C# language has
                gone through a lot of evolution and especially in recent years.
                Following the steps will help to understand some of the recent changes.
                It will give you an opportunity to apply some of the terminology and

                <p>
                    Before starting on any lab work for this class, take a few minutes
                    to create a folder structure for your labs like the one shown below.
                    Being organized is a critical survival skill in software development.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you are using the classroom lab computers, be sure to create this
                    on your USB drive and be sure to save to it! Saving on the C: drive
                    of the lab computers is a disaster waiting to happen!
                </p>
                <p>
                    Notice that the folders are numbered "lab01", "lab02", and so on. If
                    you number these using only a single digit, then when we labs 10, 11,
                    and 12, the natural ordering of your folders will be lab1, lab10,
                    lab11, lab12, lab2, lab3, ...
                </p>
                <p>
                    Since there are more than 10, and less than 100, using 2 digit
                    numbers makes sense.

                </p>
                <p>
                    For this first exercise, use the command line, not the Visual
                    Studio IDE. From Windows, you can use either the traditional
                    DOS command line (CMD) or the more modern and capable Powershell.

                    C# code is compiled to intermediate language (CIL) and processed
                    (again) by the .NET runtime CLR and optimized for the particular
                    system according to its capabilities. Simiilar to Java programs,
                    these .NET programs are contained and executed within a separate
                    runtime virtual machine environment, insulating the operating system
                    from the application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    From the command line, try: <code>dotnet --help</code><br />
                    for a brief list of available commands.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Then <code>dotnet --list-sdks</code><br />
                    to view the available installed versions on your system.

                    This will confirm whether the SDK is installed or not. As of this
                    date, Summer, 2023, .NET 6.0 (LTS), and 7.0 are supported and available
                    for download. The .NET preview release (8.0) is also available for
                    early adopters, but may not be fully tested. Since .NET 5, Microsoft
                    has announced the new release schedule will be each year in November,
                    so the new release should be getting closer to a stable build.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If none are available, browse to https://dotnet.microsoft.com/en-us/download
                    to download and install the SDKs you need. For compatibility with the
                    textbook (10th edition), use the latest version of .NET 6.0. The designator
                    "LTS" indicates Long Term Support.

                <p>
                    In my case, there were newer versions for both .NET6 and .NET7, so I
                    installed both. Downloading and running the installer took only a minute
                    or so.

                    The numbering on software releases is worth learning more about.
                    Typically the first digit indicates a major release (6 vs 7). The next
                    digit is known as a minor release (x.3 vs x.5), and subsequent digits
                    (x.x.205) indicate a build number, often associated with bug fixes
                    or security patches rather than new features or functionality.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You may also note that the .NET6.0 update removed and replaced the
                    older installation, but the .NET7.0 update was simply added to the
                    list of installed SDKs.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you have already installed Visual Studio, then chances are some
                    .NET SDK is already installed.

                    Next edit the Program.cs file using a text editor
                    (not a word processor!) like Notepad.

                    Enter the following code. Upper/Lower case matters!:
<pre>
using System;

namespace hello
{
    class Program
    {
        static void Main(string[] args)
        {
            Console.WriteLine("Hello C# Programming World!");
        }
    }
}

                </p>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        The single <code>using</code> statement indicates that we will
                        need the System library for the <code>Console</code> object methods.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The <code>namespace</code> will contain the class and other elements
                        within the scope of this application.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        "Program" is the name of the class and matches the name of the file.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        There is a single <code>static void</code> method in the class called
                        <code>Main()</code>. This is the entry point for the application.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <code>string[] args</code> are the parameters that can be passed to
                        the application, in this case from the command line.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Finally, the single command, <code>Console.WriteLine()</code> outputs
                        our message to the display. Change it from Hello, World to anything
                        else.
                    </li>
                </ul>
                <p>
                    Navigate back to the lab01 folder, build and run it as before.
                </p>

                    Starting in C# 9 (released with .NET 6.0), you don't have to
                    explicitly include a Main method in a console application project.
                    Instead, you can use the top-level statements feature to minimize
                    the code you have to write. In this case, the compiler generates a
                    class and Main method entry point for the application.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Read more: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/csharp/fundamentals/program-structure/top-level-statements
                </p>
                <p>
                    It's important to note that the top-level <code>Main()</code> and
                    <code>using</code> and <code>class</code> and <code>namespace</code>
                    statements are not gone or optional, but in simple cases, if they
                    are left out, the compiler will generate them by default.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most of the code that we write will include all of these things,
                    that is why it is essential to know what they are, what they mean,
                    and where they go. We'll talk about them more later.

                    Before we leave the command line, let's try one more thing.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Run: <code>dotnet new list</code> to see the list of templates
                    currently installed with the SDK. If you haven't installed
                    Visual Studio yet, we will in the next exercise.

            <p class="ic-flash-info">
                Review the first 9 pages of the textbook and compare
                with what you did in exercise 1 before continuing.

            <h3>Install Visual Studio</h3>
            <p>
                Visual Studio is an Integrated Development Environment.
                It is not <em>a code editor</em>, or <em>a compiler</em>,
                but a very capable set of tools including those things
                and others.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you haven't already, install Visual Studio 2022 
                (Community Edition) now. There are some notes about
                configuring it in Canvas in the
                <a href="/courses/7099152/pages/visual-studio-2022">

                If you are working in an enterprise or controlled project
                environment, there may be compelling reasons for targeting
                particular 
            </p>
            <h3>TestHello</h3>
            <p>
                Follow the steps beginning near the bottom of page 9
                to build a new <code>testhello</code> application in
                Visual Studio.
            </p>
            <p>
                In step 4(b), substitute the path to your lab01 folder.
            </p>
            <p>
                Since Visual Studio is continually being updated, some of
                the screen diagrams may look different from the images in
                the book. Make a note of any differences or questions and
                share them on the class discussion board (Discord).
            </p>
            <p>
                Some of the code also may be different depending on the 
                .NET Framework templates installed.
            </p>
            <p>
                If you run the code with the Debugger, or simply using the 
                start button, the application will run, complete, and the
                window may close before you see the output. Try starting
                without debugging from the Debug menu or from the drop-down
                option on the Start button on the toolbar.
            </p>
            <p>
                Finish the exercise, through the top of page 21, ensuring
                that your code works as expected.

            <h3>TestHelloCore</h3>
            <p>
                Because of the dependency on .NET Framework, the previous
                exercise will not work in macOS or Linux.
            </p>
            <p>
                Right-click on the Visual Studio icon running on the Windows 
                TaskBar (usually at the bottom of the screen). You may see a
                list of recent projects and solutions that you have used. 
                Near the bottom of the list there is an option to launch 
                another instance of <strong>Visual Studio</strong>. This 
                will allow you to run two instances, and work on two different
                solutions at the same time.
            </p>
            <p>
                Try the console exercise again, but this time build an application
                called 'TestHelloCore', also from the lab01 folder, but
                this time, use the <strong>Console App</strong> template 
                instead of the <strong>Console App (.NET Framework)</strong>
                template.
            </p>
            <p>
                Run and check your code. Compare the (.cs) source files between
                the two different applications. Notice the differences. Add
                your own comments (see page 24) to your code.

            <h3>UWP</h3>
            <p>
                Beginning on page 24 and through the rest of the chapter, 
                the author steps through an example using the Universal Windows
                Platform forms application. Read through this, but you do not
                need to complete or turn this part in as part of the lab.
