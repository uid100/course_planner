        <p>
            How a compiled program manages memory depends on the programming language, the compiler,
            and the runtime environment in which the program runs.
        </p>
        <p>
            A compiled program may allocate memory for data and variables at compile-time. This is
            known as static memory allocation and involves reserving memory for global variables,
            constants, and data structures whose sizes are known at compile-time. Memory for these
            variables is allocated when the program starts and is deallocated when the program exits.
        </p>
        <p>
            Many compiled languages use a stack to manage memory for function calls, local variables,
            and control flow. Each time a function is called, a new stack frame is created to store
            function parameters, local variables, and return addresses.
        </p>
        <p>
            The stack operates in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) fashion, making it a simple and efficient
            way to manage memory for function calls. Memory for stack frames is automatically allocated
            and deallocated as functions are called and return.
        </p>
        <p>
            For dynamic memory allocation, compiled programs often use the heap. Memory allocation on
            the heap is typically done explicitly by the programmer using functions like <code>malloc</code>
            (in C/C++) or <code>new</code> (in C++, Java, or C#).
        </p>
        <p>
            Memory allocated on the heap persists beyond the scope of a single function call and can be
            accessed from multiple parts of the program.
        </p>
        <p class="ic-flash-info">
            As the name suggests, data on the stack tends to be more <em>limited</em> <em>ordered</em>
            and the heap may take advantage of more available memory, including dynamic <em>swap</em>-space.
        </p>

        <ul>
            <li>
                The stack is a region of memory that is used for storing function call information, 
                local variables, and control flow data.</li>
            <li>
                It operates in a last-in, first-out (LIFO) fashion, meaning that the most recently
                called function is the first one to complete and release its memory.
            </li>
            <li>
                Each time a function is called, a new stack frame is created to store information
                about that function, including its parameters, return address, and local variables.
            </li>
            <li>
                The stack is typically a fixed-size memory region allocated when a program starts,
                and it is used for managing the execution flow of a program.
            </li>
            <li>
                It is generally faster in terms of memory access compared to the heap because of
                its straightforward and predictable allocation and deallocation.
            </li>
        </ul>
    </div>

    <div id="heap">
        <h3 class="alert alert-info">Heap</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>The heap is a region of memory used for dynamic memory allocation, where data 
                can be allocated and deallocated at runtime.</li>
            <li>Memory in the heap is allocated and deallocated explicitly by the programmer 
                and is not managed automatically by the language or runtime system.</li>
            <li>Data in the heap can persist beyond the scope of a single function call and 
                can be accessed from multiple parts of a program.</li>
            <li>Unlike the stack, the heap memory allocation and deallocation can be less 
                predictable in terms of timing, which can lead to issues like memory leaks
                or fragmentation if not managed properly.</li>
            <li>The heap allows for the allocation of objects and data structures whose size 
                or lifetime is not known at compile time.</li>

        <p>
            In many programming languages, such as C and C++, programmers have direct control over
            memory allocation on both the stack and the heap. However, in higher-level languages
            like Java, Python, and C#, memory management is abstracted from the programmer, and
            the runtime system takes care of it, often utilizing both the stack and the heap
            behind the scenes for different purposes.

        <p>
            Understanding the differences between the stack and the heap is essential for writing
            efficient and correct programs, as mismanagement of memory can lead to bugs, crashes,
            or performance issues.
