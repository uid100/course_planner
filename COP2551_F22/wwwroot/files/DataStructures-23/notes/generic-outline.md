**Course Title:** Data Structures and Algorithms Using C++

**Course Description:**
This course provides a comprehensive introduction to fundamental data structures and algorithms using the C++ programming language. Students will learn the theoretical foundations of data structures and their practical implementation. Emphasis will be placed on understanding the efficiency and performance implications of different data structures and algorithms.

**Course Duration:** 12 weeks (3 hours per week)

**Prerequisites:**
- Proficiency in C++ programming
- Basic understanding of computer science concepts

**Course Outline:**

**Week 1-2: Introduction to Data Structures and Algorithms**
- Overview of data structures and algorithms
- Time and space complexity analysis
- Big O notation
- Introduction to algorithm design paradigms (e.g., divide and conquer, greedy, dynamic programming)

**Week 3-4: Arrays and Linked Lists**
- Introduction to arrays and their properties
- Multi-dimensional arrays
- Dynamic arrays and vectors in C++
- Singly linked lists: structure, insertion, deletion
- Doubly linked lists and circular linked lists

**Week 5-6: Stacks and Queues**
- Stack data structure: principles, implementation, applications
- Queues: principles, implementation, types (e.g., linear queue, circular queue, priority queue)
- Application of stacks and queues in algorithmic problem-solving

**Week 7-8: Trees and Binary Search Trees (BST)**
- Introduction to trees: terminology, properties
- Binary trees: structure, types (full, complete, balanced)
- Binary Search Trees: insertion, deletion, traversal
- Balancing techniques (e.g., AVL trees, Red-Black trees)

**Week 9-10: Heaps, Priority Queues, and Hashing**
- Heap data structure: properties, types (min-heap, max-heap)
- Priority queues: implementation using heaps
- Hashing: hash functions, collision resolution methods (chaining, open addressing)
- Hash tables and their applications

**Week 11-12: Graphs and Advanced Topics**
- Introduction to graphs: terminology, types (directed, undirected)
- Graph representation: adjacency matrix, adjacency list
- Graph traversal algorithms: Depth-First Search (DFS), Breadth-First Search (BFS)
- Introduction to advanced topics: dynamic programming, graph algorithms (Dijkstra's, Kruskal's, etc.)
