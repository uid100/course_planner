                <strong>Graphs</strong> are a versatile and powerful abstraction for representing relationships
                between entities. Whether modeling social networks, transportation systems, or dependency relationships
                in software, graphs offer a rich framework for understanding and solving a wide array of problems.
                Graphs provide a natural way to represent and analyze complex systems. Unlike linear data structures
                such as arrays or linked lists, graphs allow us to express intricate connections and dependencies
                between individual elements.
            </p>
            <p>
                Start with understanding the terminology and structure of graphs. Examine the different types of
                graphs, such as directed and undirected graphs, weighted and unweighted edges, and cyclic and
                acyclic structures. Starting here, you will gain the tools needed to model real-world problems and
                translate them into a graph representation.
            </p>
            <p>
                With an understanding of graph fundamentals we can consider graph algorithms. These algorithms are
                designed to traverse, search, and analyze graphs efficiently. Topics include breadth-first search
                (BFS) and depth-first search (DFS) for exploring graph structures, as well as algorithms for finding
                the shortest path between nodes and detecting cycles within a graph.
            </p>
            <p>
                It is important to choose the right algorithm for the task at hand. As you have seen with other
                algorithm complexity considerations, you need to analyze the time and space complexity of graph
                algorithms, enabling you to make informed decisions about algorithm selection based on the
                requirements of your applications.
            </p>
            <p>
                Designing the best approach requires an understanding of graph algorithms and their applications as
                well as a solid foundation in data structures that will prove invaluable in tackling a wide range of
                computational challenges.
            </p>
            <p>
                At its core, a graph is a mathematical abstraction that represents a set of entities, often called
                nodes or vertices, and the <em>connections</em> between them, referred to as edges. This versatile
                structure finds applications in various domains, such as social networks, routing algorithms, and
                dependency analysis in software systems.0

                                <strong>Directed Graph (Digraph)</strong> In a directed graph, edges have a defined
                                direction, indicating a one-way relationship between nodes.
                            </li>

                                <strong>Undirected Graph</strong> Here, edges lack direction, signifying a mutual
                                connection between nodes.

                                <strong>Weighted Graph</strong> Edges in a weighted graph carry a numerical value,
                                representing a cost, distance, or some other metric associated with the connection.

                                is a path that starts and ends at the same node.

            <h3>Graph Algorithms</h3>
            <h4>Breadth-First Search (BFS):</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong> BFS explores a graph <em>level by level</em>, systematically
                visiting all the neighbors of a node before moving on to the next level.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Applications:</strong> Shortest path determination, connected components
                identification.
            </p>

            <h4>Depth-First Search (DFS):</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong> DFS explores as far as possible along each branch
                before backtracking, often employed in topological sorting and cycle detection.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Applications:</strong> Maze-solving, graph traversal.
            </p>

            <h4>Dijkstra's Algorithm:</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong> Dijkstra's algorithm finds the shortest path between
                nodes in a weighted graph.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Applications:</strong> Network routing, mapping, logistics.
            </p>

            <h4>Bellman-Ford Algorithm:</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong> Similar to Dijkstra's, Bellman-Ford finds the shortest
                path in a weighted graph but can handle graphs with negative edge weights.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Applications:</strong> Routing in networks with variable costs.
            </p>

            <h4>Topological Sorting:</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong> Organizes the nodes of a directed acyclic graph in a
                linear order respecting the partial order defined by the edges.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Applications:</strong> Task scheduling, dependency resolution.
            </p>

            <h4>Minimum Spanning Tree (Prim's and Kruskal's Algorithms):</h4>
            <p>
                <strong>Purpose:</strong> Finds the subset of edges that connects all the vertices
                in a graph with the minimum possible total edge weight.
            </p>
            <p>
                <strong>Applications:</strong> Network design, clustering, and resource optimization.
