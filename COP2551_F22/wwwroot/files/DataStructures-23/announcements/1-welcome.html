<h2>Welcome!</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    You are enrolled in <strong>COP2535 - Data Structures</strong> and should have access to the 
    course materials through Canvas (through the link on sfcollege.edu.)

    I'm Dan. This is me. I couldn't find a lot of pictures of me today, but here I am.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    If you've had one of my classes before, some of this will look familiar. I do reuse material 
    when I can, but hopefully it will still be relevant. As always, if you find any errors, 
    missing images, or broken links in the course, please let me know!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    This is a 15-week course in Data Structures using C++. We have a lot of material to cover
    but it is designed to build on the knowledge and experience you already have.&nbsp; As with 
    all programming classes, the way to succeed and even <strong><em>enjoy</em></strong> the 
    experience is to immerse yourself in it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Of course, full-immersion suggests that you're either waiting around for access to your 
    trust fund, or lottery winnings, or you just sold your first company to Jeff Bezos, and 
    you have nothing else to do. (<em>Anyone? No?</em>)
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Ok, for the rest of us, if you can trust the word of a complete stranger (<em>a friend 
    you haven't met yet,</em>) I can promise you that the more time that you are able to 
    commit to this pursuit, the more <strong>enjoyment</strong> you'll get in return. 
    I know. I used that word again! The truth is, I do <strong>enjoy</strong> programming. 
    I think a lot of us do. If you don't, consider finding something else to do, because 
    career programming only gets more demanding. Programming is a blend of science and art. 
    And the more challenging something is, the greater the sense of satisfaction when you 
    achieve it.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    I know that, in reality, most of us have family and jobs and bills and other priorities.
    <em>Hey, the sun is shining, there's a building south swell, and my friends are all 
    headed to the beach with a case of <strong>my</strong> favorite beverage on ice!</em>
    Ok, or more likely, <em>the lawn needs to be mowed, the kids have soccer practice, the 
    roof is leaking, and it's the busy season, so overtime at work is no longer optional</em>. 
    I know that life is about balancing priorities, and this course is probably not at the 
    top of that list. If you want to succeed in this class, I can promise you that it will 
    require a time commitment.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    So what can you expect?
</p>
<p>
    There are 15 weeks in the term. We are using one of Tony Gaddis' <em>stepping through</em>... 
    series of books, for the C++ language. Take a day or two now to refresh your knowledge 
    of C++ or to pick up the syntax if it isn't familiar. We'll be starting in Chapter 2, 
    but quickly jumping to more advanced concepts. You'll be using this book, and probably 
    need to refer to others, and online for more background information, and trying out the 
    concepts to explore more.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    We will use the Canvas course as a guide through the subject material. This course is not 
    new, and not new to me, but the presentation in Canvas is getting a complete refresh this 
    semester, and for that reason, you will notice that although the modules are present, 
    there is a lot of content in later modules that is not available to you yet. You may also 
    notice that each module may have a note on it indicating the content will unlock on a 
    particular date. As the content is refreshed and reviewed, I will be opening that up to 
    you, in most cases in advance of those dates. I am teaching multiple classes at multiple 
    schools this semester. This is a priority, but just know that I want to ensure the material 
    is ready for you before I release it. Also, please let me know if you see something that 
    doesn't make sense, or doesn't look correct, and I'll do my best to clarify, or correct 
    the information as quickly as I can. Thanks in advance for your patience and help!
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    Speaking of <em>online,</em><span>&nbsp;</span>the college lists this as a <em>web</em>
    course. You'll also hear it referred to as <em>asynchronous.</em> We won't have scheduled 
    meetings, but we do have a class schedule to accomplish. The Canvas course is designed to 
    guide you through, but we'll do it together, and I will make an effort to not let you 
    feel alone through the process.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>What to do next?</p>
<p>
    Find the course from your Canvas dashboard linked from the college website. Read through 
    the front page material and take a look at the links that are there. I've tried to set 
    it up so that all of the logical navigation links that you'll want are there.
</p>
<p>
    You can find out more about me, about the course, read the syllabus (there's a lot there) 
    and then go to the first module and review the first 2 chapters of the book.
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>
    I have scheduled times during the week when you can easily find me online. Please note 
    that I travel often, but all of the times listed in the course are local time at Santa 
    Fe College (EST).
</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Welcome back!</p>
