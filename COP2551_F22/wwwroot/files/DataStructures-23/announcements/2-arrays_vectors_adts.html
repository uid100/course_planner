<h2>Week2</h2>
<p>&nbsp;</p>

<p>
    Abstraction is a cornerstone in programming and software design. It involves creating classes, 
    functions, or modules that hide the inner workings of a system, providing a simplified interface 
    for interaction. For example, in object-oriented programming, a class might represent a real-world 
    object or concept, and its methods and properties abstract away the complex internal implementation 
    details.
</p>
<p>
    Hiding the complexities, or inner workings of objects and concepts simplifies their use and allows
    process and system design to be more effective and efficient.
</p>
<p>
    In the first module, we looked at <em>primitive</em> or <em>built-in</em> data types and their
    operators. This week, we'll start to consider abstract data types (ADTs).

    The first week of classes was a lot. This week I believe things are settling a bit, at least for
    me. I had hoped to have the next module ready for you earlier than I did, but as you may have 
    noticed, I was able to get it published to you only just before the start of the week. We're still
    on schedule, but I really am trying to get a little more ahead.

    As always, check in with me if you have questions. If questions in my inbox are relevant to other
    students, I will try and upload the content to Discord. If you haven't already, drop in and look 
    around. Say "Hi!"

    This week you will be writing code. The project is not particularly complex or complicated, but
    since some of you may not have spent much time programming in C++ recently, give yourself some
    extra time. Try to get your solution organized, then correct, then optimized. As long as you have
    time, there is usually something you can do to improve your code. Be sure your identifiers are
    descriptive. Don't use unnamed constants (Google "magic numbers in software"). Self-documented
    code is descriptive and intuitive. Comment where needed. Don't overuse comments. Read the instructions
    before you start, while you are developing, and before you submit the assignment.
</p>
<p>
    And of course, <bold>test your code.</bold>
