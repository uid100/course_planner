    <h2 class="alert alert-info"> Project 1 - Array Project</h2>
    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Gain technical skills using data structures through programming in C++</p>

    <h3 class="alert alert-info">Specifications</h3>
    <ol>
        <li>
            Using <strong>object-oriented principles</strong>, write a C++ program that 
            will analyze a year's worth of rainfall data.
        </li>
        <li>
            Within the class, create a private member function called <code>getData</code> 
            that will read in the data from an input file called <code>rain2019.txt</code>. 
            This file contains the total rainfall for each of the 12 months.
        </li>
        <li>
            Read the contents of this file into a <code>float</code> array.
        </li>
        <li>The class should have four private member functions that compute and return
            <ul>
                <li><code>totalRainfall</code>,</li>
                <li><code>averageRainfall</code>,</li>
                <li><code>driestMonth</code>, and </li>
                <li><code>wettestMonth</code>.</li>
            </ul>
            The last two private member functions return the number of the month with the 
            lowest and highest rainfall amounts, not the amount of rain that fell in those 
            months. Notice that the month number can be used to obtain the amount of rain 
            that fell those months.
        </li>
        <li>
            Create a private member function called <code>displayReport</code> that will 
            print a summary rainfall report similar to the following (NOTE:  this is only 
            an example of format, not accurate data):
            <pre>
    2019 Rain Report for Alachua County

    Total rainfall:  34.19 inches
    Average monthly rainfall:  2.85 inches
    The least amount of rain fell in January with 0.84 inches.
    The most rain fell in April with 4.29 inches.

    End of report.
</pre>
        </li>
        <li>
            All output values should display 2 decimal places.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use private member functions and variables.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use public member functions for a constructor (where appropriate) and 
            a driver method only.
        </li>
    </ol>

        and object appropriately will result in a project grade of 0.
