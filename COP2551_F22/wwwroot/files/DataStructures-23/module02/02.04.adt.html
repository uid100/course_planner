            An Abstract Data Type (ADT) is a high-level description of a data structure along with
            the operations that can be performed on it, without revealing the underlying implementation
            details.
        </p>
        <p>
            ADTs help in managing complexity and promoting modularity in software development.

        <h2 class="alert alert-info">Abstract Data Types (ADTs)</h2>

        <p style="font-style:italic;">
            A concept in computer science that refers to a high-level description of a data
            structure and the operations that can be performed on it, without specifying the
            underlying implementation details.
        </p>
        <p>
            In other words, an ADT defines a set of <b>behaviors and properties</b> associated
            with a data structure, while hiding the internal workings from the user. This
            separation between interface and implementation is crucial for managing complexity,
            promoting modularity, and enabling easier maintenance and code reuse.
        </p>

        <p>
            ADTs are used to encapsulate data structures and their associated operations,
            allowing programmers to focus on how to use the data structure rather than how
            it's implemented. This leads to improved code readability, maintainability, and
            reduces the risk of errors due to unintended manipulation of the internal structure.
        </p>

        <h3>Key Components of an ADT:</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <strong>Interface:</strong>
                The interface of an ADT specifies the operations that can be performed on the
                data structure, along with their parameters and return values. These operations
                are often defined using methods or functions. Examples of common ADTs include
                stacks, queues, lists, and sets. For instance, the interface of a stack ADT
                might include methods like <code>push</code>, <code>pop</code>, <code>peek</code>,
                and <code>isEmpty</code>.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Properties:</strong> An ADT also defines the properties or characteristics
                that the data structure must adhere to. These properties outline the behavior of
                the data structure and the expectations users can have when using it. For example,
                a queue ADT should follow the "first-in, first-out" (FIFO) property, where the
                element added first is the one that will be removed first.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Encapsulation:</strong>
                One of the core principles of ADTs is encapsulation. This means that the internal
                details of how the data structure is implemented are hidden from the user. Users
                of the ADT interact only with its interface, without needing to be concerned about
                the underlying algorithms or data storage mechanisms.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Implementation:</strong>
                The implementation of an ADT refers to the specific way in which the data structure
                and its operations are realized in code. Different implementations may use different
                algorithms, data structures, and optimizations while still adhering to the same ADT
                interface and properties.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Abstraction:</strong>
                ADTs provide a level of abstraction that allows developers to focus on solving
                high-level problems without getting bogged down in the technicalities of
                implementation. This abstraction aids in managing complexity and facilitates
                collaboration among software development teams.
            </li>
        </ul>

        <p>
            Abstract Data Types provide a clear separation between how a data structure is used
            and how it's implemented. By defining interfaces, properties, and encapsulation,
            ADTs enable programmers to work more effectively, promote modular design, and create
            code that's easier to maintain and understand.
        </p>

        <h2 class="alert alert-info">
            Arrays <em>vs</em> ADTs
        </h2>
        <ul>
            <li>
                Arrays are a simple and low-level data structure, while ADTs are higher-level
                abstractions that can be built using arrays or other data structures.
            </li>
            <li>
                Arrays have a fixed size and simple operations, while ADTs can have dynamic
                sizing and more complex behaviors.
            </li>
            <li>
                ADTs hide the implementation details, promoting encapsulation and modularity,
                whereas arrays expose their indexing and memory management details.
            </li>
            <li>
                ADTs provide a conceptual framework for designing and using data structures,
                whereas arrays are a specific data structure with limited functionality.
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>
            The internal implementation of ADTs can vary, and they are typically built using 
            arrays, linked lists, trees, or other data structures.
        </p>
        <p>
            Examples of ADT usage may include a stack ADT with push, pop, peek, and isEmpty 
            operations.
        </p>

        <p>
            In essence, arrays are a building block used in many data structures, including those
            that can be abstracted as ADTs. ADTs provide a way to define, organize, and work with
            data structures in a more abstract and structured manner, offering higher-level
            functionality than arrays alone.
        </p>

        <h3>Definitions</h3>
        <p>
            Arrays are a basic data structure that stores a collection of elements of the same
            data type in contiguous memory locations.
        </p>
        <p>
            ADTs are high-level concepts that define a data structure and the operations that
            can be performed on it, abstracting away the implementation details.
        </p>

        <h3>Access</h3>
        <p>
            Elements in an array are accessed using an index, which represents the position of
            an element in the array.
        </p>
        <p>
            ADTs provide an interface through which users interact with the data structure. The
            internal implementation is hidden from users.
        </p>

        <h3>Size</h3>
        <p>
            Arrays have a fixed size defined at the time of declaration, and this size cannot be
            changed during runtime.
        </p>
        <p>
            The size of an ADT may not be fixed and can be managed dynamically based on the
            operations it supports.
        </p>

        <h3>Operations</h3>
        <p>
            Basic operations on arrays include element access, modification, and traversal.
        </p>
        <p>
            ADTs define a set of operations that can be performed which may involve complex
            behaviors and properties.
        </p>

        <h3>Complexity</h3>
        <p>
            Accessing elements by index is fast and has constant time complexity O(1).
        </p>
        <p>
            Operation complexity depends on the specific ADT and its implementation.
