<h2 class="alert alert-info">Introductions</h2>
<h3>Purpose:</h3>
<ul>
    <li>
        Since we don't have the opportunity to go around the classroom and have 
        people introduce themselves, we're going to do an online introduction 
        and share a little bit about ourselves.
    </li>
</ul>

<h3>Directions:</h3>

        (optional) Add your picture to your Canvas profile. From the Canvas main 
        menu (typically on the upper left side of your screen), select Account 
        and go to Settings and upload a picture.

        (10 points) Click reply below, and add a post introducing yourself to the 
        class. Share at least one or two good paragraphs so others in the class 
        can find some things in common with you. Ideas might include: what you 
        currently do, your major, why you are taking this class, what you would 
        like to do after you finish your degree, hobbies, special interests, 
        where you're originally from, where you live (general area), family, etc. 
        You can upload pictures if you want to.

        In the field of software engineering, from time-to-time, you may be 
        invited to technical interviews. You may be asked for simple 
        definitions for common concepts, perhaps the 4 pillars of object-oriented
        programming, or the phases of the software development life cycle. You can
        probably think of other common concepts that you've learned in classes.
        For these, your instructor, or textbook, or <em>the Google(!)</em> offered
        a working definition and it was enough to satisfy the question at the time.
        <br />
        It's a good idea to take some of these basic concepts, maybe find a few 
        example definitions, and then define them in your own words, and refine
        and practice them, so that they're ready for interview responses.
        For example, you know what a variable is. Our textbook says <em>Variables
        represent storage locations in the computer's memory.</em>
        <br />My definition is:
        <br />
        <blockquote>
            A variable is a named storage location in the computer's memory
            where a value may be stored and accessed later. The value of a 
            variable can be changed (may "vary") throughout the execution
            of a program.
        </blockquote>
        <br />
        (20 points) In a paragraph or two, discuss:
        <br />
        Do you agree with this definition? Is it more or less clear, 
        concise, or correct than what you can find in the textbook or a web search?
        Are there other terms or concepts that you have learned that you might want
        to revisit and commit to memory before an interview? (encapsulation, 
        polymorphism, abstraction, test-driven development, frameworks, ...)

        (10+10 points possible) As part of your introduction, find and share 2 
        things you have in common with person at least two other people in the 
        discussion. To respond to my post or somebody else's post on this thread, click 
        inside the Reply box, enter your introduction or response and click the Post 
        Reply button.

<p>
    Posts and replies should be thoughtful and respectful.
