        <h2>Where do I go next?</h2>
        <h3 class="alert alert-info"><em>about the Home page</em></h3>
        <p>
            Take the time to become familiar with the material on, and linked from that front (Home) page.
            It's not expected to change often. There are links from that home page intended to get you
            quickly to the page(s) you need. As a virtual <em>sign-post</em>, you'll also find a link
            (button) to get back to that page throughout many other pages in the course.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each time you come back to the Canvas course, start at the Home page. If there are any
            announcements, the most current will be shown at the top of the page. If you missed something
            or want to read an earlier announcement, use the Announcements link from the main Canvas menu
            (usually on the left side of the screen, may be different on a mobile device.)

        <p>
            This course content is organized by Modules in Canvas.
        </p>
        <p>
            We will be covering approximately one module per week, beginning with Module 1.
        </p>
        <p>
            Module 0 contains additional student resources that may be helpful. If you find more content
            that you think would be helpful to students, let me know and I can add it to that list of
            resources.
        </p>
        <p>
            Any time that you read a textbook or informational reference, always start with the table of
            contents. Like a meeting agenda, it provides a structured outline of the material to be covered.
            After you've studied the section or chapter of interest, I strongly recommend reviewing the
            table of contents again as a reminder and quick review of what you read.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, the course outline, with links to each module, is provided in the syllabus, and also
            on that front page, both to get provide quick user navigation, and as a reminder of the topics
            that have been covered (and are to be covered.)
        </p>
        <p>
            Each Module will start with a summary of what to expect and what to complete. You can navigate
            through the pages from the Modules link on the main Canvas page, using the individual pages, or
            from the [Next >] button at the bottom of each page inside the module. Be sure to click through
            all of the pages.

        <h3 class="alert alert-info"><em>living documents</em></h3>
        <p>
            When webpages were new to the general public and quickly becoming commonplace, the phrase
            <em>
                "this page under construction"
            </em>
            was in common use. It fell out of favor when dynamic content became not only the norm, but
            the expectation. Users understood that <em>all pages were under construction</em>, and stating
            the obvious became more and more rare.
        </p>
        <p>
            With that said, I will state the obvious. These pages are in a <em>final draft</em> state, and
            are almost certain to contain errors, inconsistencies, missing links, and simply opportunities
            for improvement. The more times they are used and reviewed, the better for all.
        </p>
        <p>
            Peer review is a vital part of the engineering process and industry. If you find an <del>errorror</del>
            <ins>error</ins> or have a question or suggestion about something in the course, please let me know
            and I will review and make any changes or updates as soon as possible.
