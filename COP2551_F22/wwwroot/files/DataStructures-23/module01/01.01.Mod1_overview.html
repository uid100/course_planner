            <h3>Let's Review!</h3>
            <p>
                This week, we're going to dive into the beginning of our textbook. 
                But don't be misled. We won't be moving sequentially through the 
                book.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most professional developers have at least some experience with 
                multiple languages. It is not unusual to work for months and even
                years at a time with a team of developers using the a single language
                and relatively static development environment. Often programmers 
                will acquire a comfort level and even an affinity for one language
                out of familiarity. Having an exposure to- and working knowledge of
                multiple programming languages will make you a better engineer.
            </p>
            <p>
                The pre-requisites of this course imply a certain level of experience
                with at least a couple of programming languages. Most of the languages 
                you have encountered will share certain things in common, and most of 
                the programs and projects you have tackled, shared common logic,
                approaches, and patterns. Conditional statements, looping, assignments,
                string manipulation, and math operations. The syntax may vary, but 
                the similarities should be very apparent by now. 
            </p>
            <p>
                For most of you, C++ is not a new language. If this is a new experience,
                take the time to browse through the first few chapters to come up to 
                speed, or if it has been a while, consider trying some of the examples
                to refresh your memory. I believe you will be comfortable enough very
                quickly.
            </p>
            <h3>Data-centric</h3>
            <p>
                So, given that you have the solid foundation of those patterns and 
                practices, in this course we'll be taking a closer look at the data
                structures, and how to optimize code. These topics are generally not
                language-specific, but C++ is a good platform to do that investigation.
            </p>
