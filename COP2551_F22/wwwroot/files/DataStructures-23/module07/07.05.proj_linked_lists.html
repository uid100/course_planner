    <h3>Purpose</h3>
    <p>Gain technical skills using data structures through programming in C++</p>

    <p>&nbsp;</p>

    <h3 class="alert alert-info">Specifications</h3>

    <p>
        Write a C++ program that will  read an input file to manage a list of 
        students waiting to register for a course using a linked list.
    </p>

    <p>
        The input file name is <code>WaitList.txt</code> and will be located 
        in the current directory of the project.
    </p>

    <table style="width:50%; margin:30px 10px 30px 10px;">
        <caption>The input file layout is as follows:</caption>
        <tr><th scope="col" style="width: 30%;">action</th><th scope="col" style="width: 70%">student name</th></tr>
    </table>

    <p>
        Actions are defined as follows:
        <ul>
            <li>add student name to the end of the linked list</li>
            <li>add student name to the beginning of the linked list</li>
            <li>delete the student at the beginning of the linked list</li>
            <li>delete the student at the end of the linked list</li>
        </ul>
    </p>

    <p>
        Actions #1 and #2 require student names. Actions #3 and #4 do not.
        <table style="width: 50%; margin: 30px 10px 30px 10px;">
            <caption>For example, if the input file contents contained:</caption>
            <thead>
                <tr><th scope="col" style="width: 30%;">action</th><th scope="col" style="width: 70%">student name</th></tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr><td style="text-align: center">1</td><td style="text-align: center">Sally Sue Student</td></tr>
                <tr><td style="text-align: center">1</td><td style="text-align: center">Peter Pupil</td></tr>
                <tr><td style="text-align: center">1</td><td style="text-align: center">Sam Scholar</td></tr>
                <tr><td style="text-align: center">4</td><td style="text-align: center"></td></tr>
                <tr><td style="text-align: center">2</td><td style="text-align: center">Terri Tutor</td></tr>
                <tr><td style="text-align: center">1</td><td style="text-align: center">Abby Achiever</td></tr>
                <tr><td style="text-align: center">3</td><td style="text-align: center"></td></tr>
                <tr><td style="text-align: center">2</td><td style="text-align: center">Bill Brain</td></tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
    </p>

    <p>
        The program would display the wait list as follows:
<pre>
The Wait List:

1.  Bill Brain
2.  Sally Sue Student
3.  Peter Pupil
4.  Abby Achiever

End of List.
</pre>
    </p>

    <p>
        ...Then the program will prompt the user if they wish to delete a student by name.
        If the user selects 'y', the program will prompt for a student name.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the name is found in the linked list, the student node will be deleted and 
        the wait list is then displayed. If the name is not found, an error message is 
        displayed to the user.
    </p>
    <p>
        If the user selects 'n' to deleting a student by name, the program will end.
        <pre>
The Wait List:

1.  Bill Brain
2.  Sally Sue Student
3.  Peter Pupil
4.  Abby Achiever

End of List.


Would you like to delete a student by name (y = yes, n = no): Y
Enter the full name of the student to delete:  peter pupil

Student deleted.


The Wait List:

1.  Bill Brain
2.  Sally Sue Student
3.  Abby Achiever

End of List.


Would you like to delete a student by name (y = yes, n = no):  y
Enter the full name of the student to delete:  casey clever

Student does not exist on the wait list.


The Wait List:

1.  Bill Brain
2.  Sally Sue Student
3.  Abby Achiever

End of List.


Would you like to delete a student by name (y = yes, n = no):  a
Invalid response, please enter y = yes, n = no:  n

Program end.
</pre>
    </p>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Validate all user input values.
        </li>
        <li>
            Be sure to use good programming methodology and keep your project modular.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use private member functions and variables.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use public member functions for a constructor (where appropriate) and a 
            driver method only.
        </li>
        <li>
            These specifications do not give a list of method names to be used. It is 
            assumed the program will use several methods doing one task each.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <strong>Note:</strong> any submission that uses global variables, unnamed constants
        (magic numbers), or does not use a class and object appropriately will result in a
        project grade of 0.
