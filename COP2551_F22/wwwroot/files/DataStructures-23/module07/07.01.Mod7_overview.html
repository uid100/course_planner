            While an array is stored in a single place in memory, linked lists can use available memory 
            in different parts of the system's memory. With an array, accessing the next element, and 
            the one after, is a simple matter of calculating the number of items of the index, times the
            size of the element type, to access the next place in memory where the value is stored.
        </p>
        <h3 class="alert alert-info" >Linked Lists</h3>
        <p>
            Imagine a linked list as a chain of nodes, where each node is like a little packet of 
            information that's linked to the next one in line, forming a sequence. It's like a train with 
            cars, and each car (node) knows where the next car is.
        </p>
        <p>
            Each node in the linked list has two parts: one holds the actual data you want to store, like 
            numbers or words, and the other part points to the next node in the list. So, you can think of 
            it as a series of interconnected data pockets.
        </p>
        <p>
            Unlike an array where all the data is lined up in a row, linked lists can be a bit scattered.
            It's like having a bunch of post-it notes stuck on a wall, and you have to follow the arrows 
            (pointers) from one note to the next to read all the information in order.
        </p>
        <p>
            Linked lists are pretty flexible because you can add or remove nodes relatively easily without 
            shifting everything around like you would with an array. However, accessing a specific node can 
            be a bit slower because you have to start from the beginning and follow the links until you reach 
            your destination.
        </p>

            You may be familiar with the classic toy "A Barrel of Monkeys." It consisted of a plastic
            barrel filled with small plastic monkey figures. Each mokey has arms that can be hooked together
            to form a chain. Like linked lists, if a piece (monkey) in the middle of the chain is removed, 
            then the one above it becomes the last one, and the location of the rest of the list is no 
            longer known. But with careful reassignment of the node elements can be inserted or deleted
            from anywhere in the list.
        </p>

            In this module, read through the notes in the module and the informatin in Chapter 18. Pay
            careful attention to how the integrity of the entire list is maintained as members are moved,
            inserted, or deleted. 
        </p>
        <p>
            Take the time to build the sample code in the chapter. It will be helpful for completing the
            assigned exercise.
