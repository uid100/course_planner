        Using <strong>object-oriented principles</strong>, write a C++ program that will compare 
        two arrays to test for the same elements and multiplicity.

    <p>Gain technical skills using data structures through programming in C++</p>

    <h3 class="alert alert-info">Specifications</h3>

    <h4>Pointers</h4>
    <ul>
        <li>
            Write a C++ program that will compare two arrays to test for the same elements 
            and multiplicity.
        </li>
        <li>
            To begin, populate the arrays with the input files, comFile1.txt and comFile2.txt.
        </li>
        <li>
            The elements in the arrays do not need to be in the same order for them to be
            considered similar. For example<br />
<pre>
array 1:    121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19, 11
array 2:    11, 121, 144, 19, 161, 19, 144, 19
</pre>
            would be considered to have the same elements because 19 appears 3 times in each 
            array, 144 appears twice in each array, and all other elements appear once in
            each array.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use pointer notation instead of array notation whenever possible. (Chapter 10)
        </li>
        <li>
            Display whether or not the arrays have the same elements and multiplicity.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use private member functions and variables.
        </li>
        <li>
            Use public member functions for a constructor (where appropriate) and a driver 
            method only. This should be named something descriptive, <em>hint: not <b>driver</b></em>.
        </li>
        <li>
            These specifications do not give a list of method names to be used. It is assumed 
            the program will use several methods doing one task each.
        </li>
    </ul>

        <strong>Note:</strong> any submission that uses global variables, unnamed constants
        (magic numbers), or does not use a class and object appropriately will result in a
        project grade of 0.
    </p>

    <h4>Input Data</h4>
    <p>
        The arrays listed above are just an example. These, and others should be used for 
        testing. The values should not be hard-coded in your solution.
    </p>
