        <h2 class="alert alert-info">Queues</h2>
            <p>
                A queue is another linear data structure in C++ that follows the First-In-First-Out (FIFO) 
                principle. It can be thought of as a collection of elements with two primary operations: 
                enqueue and dequeue.
            <p>
                Elements are added to the back of the queue using the enqueue operation, and they are removed 
                from the front of the queue using the dequeue operation.
            </p>

            <h3 class="alert alert-info">Common Uses of Queues in C++</h3>

            <ul>
                <li><strong>Task Scheduling:</strong> Queues are often used in task scheduling algorithms. 
                In real-time systems, processes or tasks are added to a queue based on their priority or 
                arrival time. The task with the highest priority or the first to arrive is dequeued and 
                executed next.</li>

                <li><strong>Breadth-First Search (BFS):</strong> In graph algorithms, BFS uses a queue to 
                explore and traverse all nodes at the current level before moving to the next level. This 
                is useful for finding shortest paths in unweighted graphs and solving various graph-related 
                problems.</li>

                <li><strong>Print Queue:</strong> In printer management systems, print jobs are often stored 
                in a queue. The jobs are processed in the order they are received, ensuring fairness in 
                printing and preventing resource contention.</li>

                <li><strong>Task Management in Multithreading:</strong> Queues are valuable for managing 
                tasks in a multithreaded environment. Worker threads can dequeue tasks from a queue and 
                execute them concurrently, ensuring proper synchronization and load balancing.</li>

                <li><strong>Buffering and Data Streaming:</strong> Queues can be used to buffer data in 
                streaming applications. Data producers enqueue data, and consumers dequeue and process it. 
                This ensures a smooth and controlled flow of data.</li>
            </ul>

            <h3>Using Queues in C++</h3>

            <p>
                In C++, queues can be implemented using various data structures, such as arrays, linked 
                lists, or the standard library's <code>std::queue</code> container. Here's a basic example
                using <code>std::queue</code>:
            </p>

<pre>
<code>
        #include &lt;iostream&gt;
        #include &lt;queue&gt;

        int main() {
            std::queue&lt;int&gt; myQueue;
    
            // Enqueue elements
            myQueue.push(10);
            myQueue.push(20);
            myQueue.push(30);
    
            // Dequeue elements
            while (!myQueue.empty()) {
                std::cout &lt;&lt; myQueue.front() &lt;&lt; " "; // Print front element
                myQueue.pop(); // Remove front element
            }
    
            return 0;
        }
</code>
