        <h3 style="font-style:italic;">What is a hash function</h3>

        <p class="ic-flash-info">
            A hash function is a mathematical function that takes an input (or "message") and returns
            a fixed-size string of bytes. The output, commonly called the hash code or hash value, is
            typically a digest that is unique to each unique input.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hash functions are widely used for various purposes, especially in cryptography.
        </p>

        <p>
            Hash functions are designed:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    ... to be <b>Deterministic</b>. For the same input, the hash function
                    should always produce the same output.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ... to be <b>Efficient</b>. It should be computationally efficient to
                    compute the hash value for any given input.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ... to have a <b>Fixed Output Size</b>. The hash function should produce
                    a fixed-size output, regardless of the size of the input.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ... to be <b>Collision Resistant</b>. It should be computationally
                    <i>infeasible</i> to find two different inputs that produce the same hash
                    value. In practice, this property is essential to ensure the integrity of
                    data and the security of hash-based algorithms.
                </li>
                <li>
                    ... to have an <b>Avalanche Effect</b>. A small change in the input
                    should result in a significantly different hash value. This property
                    ensures that similar inputs have very different hash codes.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a seemingly simple description of what can be very complex mathematical
            applications.
        </p>
        <h3>For Example <em>Passwords</em></h3>
        <p>
            Here's a common use-case. A user sets an access password. Imagine that password
            can contain upper and lower case values of the 26 letters of the english language
            plus 10 numeric digits and maybe a hanful of allowable printable characters. To
            make it more complex, it may be between 10 and 20 characters long. This unknown
            length combination of perhaps 70 or more pseudo-random characters presents as...
            (skipping the math...) a <em>whole lot(!) of</em> possible combinations.
        </p>
        <p>
            If you run this password string through one of our complex hash functions, it
            produces a presumably unique string that is equally random. Because of the
            characteristics of the hash function described above, even storing this value as
            plain text, makes guessing or even calculating the source string very unlikely,
            or at the least, very computationally complicated.
        </p>
        <p>
            So when the authorized user returns and re-enters the pre-selected password, and
            it is again validated against the same hash function, only the exact password
            will result in a match with the stored password hash.
        </p>

        <h3>Common Uses</h3>
        <p>
            Hash functions are used in various applications, such as:
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <strong>Data Integrity</strong> Verifying the integrity of data by comparing
                    hash values before and after transmission or storage. If the data has been
                    altered even slightly, the hash value will not match.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Hash Tables</strong> Efficiently organizing and retrieving data in hash
                    tables and other data structures.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Digital Signatures</strong> Ensuring the authenticity and integrity
                    of messages and documents. Similar to the way that a data transfer can be
                    checked as described above, the source for a message or document can also be
                    checked using hashes.
                </li>
                <li>
                    <strong>Cryptography</strong> Password storage, and other security applications.
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            Common hash functions used in cryptography include
            <ul>
                <li>MD5 (Message Digest 5)</li>
                <li>SHA-1 (Secure Hash Algorithm 1)</li>
                <li>SHA-256</li>
                <li>SHA-3</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Older hash functions like MD5 and SHA-1 are still used in some contexts, they are
            considered insecure for cryptographic purposes due to vulnerabilities, and more secure
            hash functions are recommended for new applications.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h2 class="alert alert-info">Hash Tables</h2>
        <p>
            Hash functions do not need to be complex and <em>unbreakable</em> to be useful or effective.
            The application will determine the complexity of the hash function.

        <h3 style="font-style:italic;">What is a hash table</h3>

        <p class="ic-flash-info">
            A hash table (also known as a hash map) is a <strong>data structure</strong> that implements
            an associative array abstract data type (ADT), a structure that can map keys to values. It
            uses a <em>hash function</em> to compute an index into an array of buckets or slots, from
            which the desired value can be found.
        </p>
        <p style="font-weight:bold">
            The idea behind a hash table is to transform the key into a hash code, which is used as an
            index to access the corresponding value in the array.
        </p>
        <p>
            Ideally, each unique key should produce a unique hash code, but in practice, <em>collisions</em>
            (two different keys producing the same hash code) can occur. Various techniques are used to
            handle collisions.
        </p>
        <p>
            Two common approaches are
            <ul>
                <li>Separate chaining, and</li>
                <li>Open addressing</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <h3 style="font-style:italic;">How a hash table works</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>
                A <strong>hash function</strong> takes a key as input and produces a hash code, <em>integer</em> 
                to be used as an index to where the corresponding value should be stored or looked up.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Buckets</strong> The hash table typically consists of an array (or vector) of buckets or 
                slots. Each bucket can hold multiple key-value pairs in the case of collisions.
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Collision Resolution</strong> (when more than one key-value resolves to the same index)
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Separate Chaining</strong> Each bucket contains a linked list (or another 
                        data structure) to store multiple key-value pairs with the same hash code. (To hold 
                        multiple values at the same index)
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Open Addressing</strong> If a collision occurs, search for the next available 
                        slot (the next "open address) in the array (linear probing is one common method) until 
                        an empty slot is found. Although the hash function may not find the key in the table
                        immediately, if the search starts there, the algorithm should not have to search far
                        starting from there to find the target. 
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>
                <strong>Table Operations</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Insert</strong> The key-value pair is inserted into the bucket determined by 
                        the hash code.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Retrieve</strong> The hash code is used to find the appropriate bucket, and 
                        then the key is searched within the bucket to retrieve the associated value.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        <strong>Delete</strong> Similar to retrieval, the key is located in the corresponding 
                        bucket, and the key-value pair is removed.
                    </li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>
            Hash tables provide fast average-case time complexity for basic operations (insertion, retrieval, 
            and deletion), making them efficient for tasks like indexing and searching.
        </p>
        <p>
            Compared with the other search algorithms we've looked at, this makes a lot of sense.
        </p>
        <p class="ic-flash-info">
            <strong>Searching is faster when you know where to start looking</strong>
        </p>
        <p>
            The efficiency depends on the quality of the hash function and the collision resolution strategy 
            employed. Simpler hash functions are more likely for collisions to occur.
        </p>
        <p>
            Common programming languages often provide built-in implementations of hash tables, such as 
            Python's <code>dict</code> or C++'s <code>std::unordered_map</code>.
