        <h2 class="alert alert-info">C++ Structures</h2>
        <p>
            C++ <b>structs</b> are a fundamental feature of the C++ programming language that
            allow you to create custom data types to group together variables of different
            data types under a single name. These user-defined data structures are similar
            to classes but have some key differences that make them particularly useful
            for specific tasks.
        </p>

        <h3>Defining a Struct</h3>
        <p>
            In C++, you can define a struct using the <code>struct</code> keyword followed
            by the struct's name. Inside the struct, you can declare data members, also known
            as fields or properties, which can have different data types. For example:
        </p>

<pre>
<code>
    struct Person {
        std::string name;
        int age;
    };
</code>
</pre>

        <p>
            In this example, we've defined a <code>Person</code> struct with two data members:
            <code>name</code> of type <code>std::string</code> and <code>age</code> of type
            <code>int</code>.
        </p>

        <h33>Accessing Struct Members</h33>
        <p>
            Struct members can be accessed using the dot (.) operator. For instance, to set the
            <code>name</code> and <code>age</code> of a <code>Person</code> struct:
        </p>

<pre>
<code>
        Person person1;
        person1.name = "John Doe";
        person1.age = 30;
</code>
</pre>

        <h3>Use Cases</h3>
        <p>
            C++ structs are commonly used for creating lightweight data structures to represent
            records, coordinate points, and other related data. They are also used for passing
            multiple values to functions and organizing data in a more structured manner.
        </p>

        <p>
            While structs provide a way to group data together, they lack the advanced features
            of classes, such as member functions (methods) and access control modifiers.
            Therefore, structs are often preferred when simplicity and easy access to data are
            the primary concerns.
        </p>

        <hr />
        <p>
            C++ structs are a versatile tool for organizing and managing data in your programs.
            They offer a straightforward way to group related data elements and are especially
            useful when you need a simple, lightweight data structure without the complexities
            of classes.

        <h2 class="alert alert-info">Structs vs Objects</h2>
        <p>
            Reviewing the fundamentals of using structs and objects reveals some similarity and often
            leads to the question of when to use each.
        </p>
        <p>
            In C++, both structs and objects are used to define composite data types that can group
            together variables of different types. However, there are some key differences.
        </p>

        <h3>Access Control</h3>
        <p>
            For structs: In a struct, the default access control for its members is "public." This means
            that the data members of a struct are accessible directly from outside the struct, and there
            is no encapsulation by default.
        </p>
        <p>
            For objects (classes): In a class, the default access control for its members is "private."
            This means that data members of a class are not accessible directly from outside the class,
            promoting encapsulation.
        </p>

        <h3>Encapsulation</h3>
        <p>
            Structs typically do not emphasize encapsulation and are often used for simple data containers.
            In a struct, you usually have public data members that can be accessed directly.
        </p>
        <p>
            Objects (instances of classes) are designed with encapsulation in mind. They usually have
            private data members and provide public member functions (methods) to interact with and
            manipulate those data members. This encapsulation helps control access to the data and
            allows for better data integrity and security.
        </p>

        <h3>Inheritance</h3>
        <p>
            Both structs and classes can be used as base classes for inheritance in C++. The only
            difference is the default access control.
        </p>
        <p>
            Structs can be used for inheritance, but they use public inheritance by default, which
            means that public members of the base struct remain public in the derived struct.
        </p>
        <p>
            Classes, on the other hand, use private inheritance by default, so public members of
            the base class become private members in the derived class.
        </p>

        <h3>Constructor (and Destructor)</h3>
        <p>
            Classes (objects) can have constructors and destructors, which allow for initialization
            and cleanup operations when objects are created and destroyed.
        </p>
        <p>
            Structs can also have constructors and destructors in C++, but this is less common, and
            they are typically used for more complex structs.
        </p>

        <h3>Typical Use Cases</h3>
        <p>
            Structs are often used for simple data structures that group related variables together,
            such as coordinates (x, y, z) or data records.
        </p>
        <p>
            Objects (classes) are used for more complex data structures that include both data
            members and associated behaviors (methods), implementing object-oriented programming
            concepts like encapsulation, inheritance, and polymorphism.
        </p>

        <hr />
        <p>
            Both structs and objects (classes) can be used to define composite data types (in C++).
        </p>
        <p>
            Structs are often used for simple data containers with public access to their members,
            while objects (classes) are used for more complex data structures with encapsulation
            and private access to data members and methods for behavior.
