                            HyFlex classes are taught on campus at scheduled days and times like a traditional class.
                            Unlike a traditional class, HyFlex teachers use Zoom to broadcast their live class session.
                            This means that in most cases students can CHOOSE whether to attend class on campus or via
                            Zoom.
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Some teachers require in-person attendance for some class sessions, so check with the
                            instructor for attendance requirements.  Some teachers may also record the Zoom class sessions
                            to share with students enrolled in the class.

                <p style="font-style:italic;">
                    So, how's this going to work?
                </p>
                <p>
                    I have taught classes, <strong>this course in fact</strong>, both online and in the classroom.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>HyFlex</strong>, is an aggregation of the words <em>hybrid</em> and <em>flexible</em>.
                    This means that as a hybrid course, it is intended to be taught both in the classroom and
                    simultaneously online <em>via</em> <strong>Zoom</strong> conference, and allows the flexibility
                    for students to attend either.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I understand that there are circumstances which may prevent students from getting to campus, for
                    example transportation, schedule commitments, and geography. This approach is meant to allow
                    access to opportunities that students might not otherwise have.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you can attend class, please do. If you cannot, then you are welcome to join remotely.
                </p>

                <h3>Requirements</h3>
                <p>
                    For remote participation, the requirements for joining are the same as for any Zoom 
                    video-conferencing experience that you have had. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    A Camera and Microphone are strongly recommended and at a minimum, you will need to be
                    able and prepared to interact with the class with your computer. Do not login and 
                    <em>disappear</em>. Not being in class does not mean you will not be expected to 
                    engage. 
                </p>

                <h3>Attendance</h3>
                <p>
                    From reading the syllabus, you have seen that there is no grade for attendance or even class
                    participation. Student success is measured from learning the material and demonstrating
                    understanding through the quizzes and exercise assignments.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The material for this course is all contained in the Canvas server pages and augmented by
                    textbook and resource links listed there. I believe the content is valuable, relevant
                    to the industry, and that the course presents a worthwhile learning environment. I have
                    invested a lot of time to try to compile the material in a way that is clear, complete,
                    and concise.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Yes. I am saying that there is no requirement to attend class, and I won't take it
                    personally if you decide not to. This is <em>your</em> class. Succeeding in this class
                    is <em>your</em> responsibility. It is my job to help you do that.
                </p>
                <p>
                    I will track class attendance, both in-class and online for my own metrics, but there 
                    aren't points for sitting in a chair or logging into a video conference.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There are, of course benefits to attending the lecture. I am the one who is grading your
                    work. It makes sense that you'd want to hear directly from me about expectations and 
                    specific instructions, and be able to direct your questions directly to me in advance of 
                    submitting your work.
                </p>
                <h3><em>Lack of</em> Attendance</h3>
                <p>
                    Pay attention to the attendance section in the syllabus. Although you won't earn or lose
                    points for attendance, Canvas does log student activity within the system. Missing 
                    assignments, and lack of engagement with the class resources, may result in being 
                    dropped from the class for 'excessive absence.'
