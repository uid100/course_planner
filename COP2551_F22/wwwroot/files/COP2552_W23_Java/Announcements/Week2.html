        <h3>Housekeeping</h3>
        <p>
            We're just getting started with this school term, and we're still getting acquainted. 
            Many of your names are familiar from my OOP-1 course. Some of this will feel familiar. 
            Welcome back.
        </p>
        <p>
            I had a couple of visitors during office hours. My other classes were quiet last week 
            (not surprising for the beginning of the term.)&nbsp; As a reminder, I am available 
            during the week, check the home page or syllabus for the schedule or use email. And 
            don't forget the Discord channel that is set up just for this class too! Online doesn't 
            have to mean <em>alone.</em>
        </p>
        <p>
            I've gotten a few student emails, but as expected at the beginning of the term, most 
            questions are more administrative than technical.
        </p>
        <p>
            Yes, there were some errors in assignment (exam) dates. I think they're all correct 
            now, but as always, please let me know if you find something in the course material 
            that could be clearer.
        </p>

        <h2>Language</h2>

        <h3>Aloha mai kākou!</h3>
        <p>
            In the Hawaiian language ( '&otilde;lelo ) and traditions, aloha is much more than a 
            catchy phrase on a t-shirt or bumper sticker. It originates from the word 'alo' which 
            is "to face" or "be present" and "ha" which is a breath. Together, "aloha" is the 
            presence of breath, the first signs of life we exhibit after birth, and the shared 
            experience of life itself. "Aloha mai kākou" is a collective greeting, it is a shared 
            aloha between all of us.
        </p>
        <p>
            I enjoy traveling when I can and the Hawaiian islands are one of my favorite destinations. 
            I have spent a lot of time on most of the major islands. Generally, I think that a study 
            of language offers better insight to a people and a culture.
        </p>
        <p>
            This is a language class, do you think the same concept can be applied to computer 
            programming? The Java programming language has a history and an evolution. The language 
            development is steered by people and experiences and influenced by other languages and 
            even cultures and environments. It's an interesting thought. Consider the programming 
            languages that you've used and the (usually simple) examples that you've coded. Can you 
            see the patterns and parallels between them? Do you ever stop and ask why there are 
            differences and what drove the development?
        </p>
        <p>
            <em>How many times has a computer been told to echo "Hello World" and by how many people, 
            in how many languages?</em>
        </p>

        <h2>Java and Project 1</h2>
        <h3>JOptionsPane</h3>
        <p>
            One student had an interesting question about the use of JOptionsPane in Chapter 2 and
            I thought I'd share my response with the rest of you.
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            <em>
                What is the difference in using JOptionsPane and JFrame? I have programmed GUIs in
                Java prior to this class and always used JFrames.
            </em>
        </p>
        <p>
            The short answer is that JOptionsPane is a simple dialog box. It's a way to get
            information to the user very simply and very quickly. One of the first things to
            notice is that it's a <em>modal</em> dialog box. That means it's a <em>blocking</em>
            action. The dialog will stop program execution until it is acted on and dismissed.
            The two classes also have different inheritance. If you refer to the Oracle docs,
            you can see that they have different intended uses and purposes.
        </p>
        <p>
            It's a great question, and we will use both, but for these first exercises, the
            "keep it simple" mantra prevails. Follow the examples from the book.
        </p>

        <h3>Conventions</h3>
        <p>
            The instructions for Project 1 include:
            <ul>
                <li>>Follow all good programming naming conventions.</li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            What are naming conventions?
        </p>
        <p>
            There are <strong>case styles.</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>camelCase</li>
                        <li>PascalCase</li>
                        <li>snake_case</li>
                        <li>kebab-case</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ul>
        </p>
        <p>
            Languages usually have their own standards. Snake_case (separating with underscores) 
            is commonly used in Python code, kebab-case, hyphenated is often seen in javascript 
            and CSS.
        </p>
        <p>
            camelCase and PascalCase are usually included as part of the language coding standards 
            for C# and Java.
        </p>

        <h3>Self-documenting code</h3>
        <p>
            That's a good start, but there's more.
        </p>
        <p>
            Self-documenting code also means using descriptive variable names. Consider the following:
        </p>
<pre>
int numberOfStudents;
float heightInInches;
static final float CM_PER_INCH = 2.54;
</pre>
        <p>
            None of these lines of code contain any comments, but it is very clear what each of these 
            identifiers' purpose is and when they occur anywhere in code, you have a pretty good idea 
            what that variable (or constant) is meant to contain.
        </p>
<pre>
LOCAL_SALES_TAX = .0925 // for Nashville,TN 2023
</pre>
        <p>Comments should be used to explain or clarify code, not in place of writing clear code.</p>
        <p>For comparison:</p>
<pre>
value = dataEntered * 27.3;
static float CONSTANT = 3958.8;
x = java.lang.Math.sqrt( newValue ) / CONSTANT;
</pre>
        <p>
            This code may be correct, but there is no indication of what are these numbers for or what 
            this code does. If you had to find and fix an error how would you know where to start?
        </p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>
        <p>
            As a rule, if there are numbers or string variables anywhere in your code, is it obvious 
            what they are for? Could they be assigned to an identifier to make them clearer and ensure 
            they are defined in only one place?</p>
        <p>&nbsp;</p>

        <hr /> <!-- ------------ -->

        <p>A quick web search found these guidelines for Java coding</p>
        <ul class="regular">
            <li>Use descriptive names for all variables, function names, constants, and other identifiers.</li>
            <li>Use single letter identifiers only for the counter in loops.</li>
            <li>Class names start with an upper case letter.</li>
            <li>Variable names start with a lower case letter. (Variables include parameters, local variables, 
            and data fields. Exception: use UPPER_CASE for constants - final variables.)</li>
            <li>Method names start with a lower case letter.</li>
            <li>Multi-word identifiers are internally capitalized.</li>
            <li>Do not use hyphens or underscores to separate multi-word identifiers (except for constants, 
            which have all upper case letters).</li>
        </ul>
